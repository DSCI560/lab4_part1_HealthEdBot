38,USA-China new digital Cold War?,". Huawei, among other items, makes a key product called radio access networks, (or RANs) the part of a telecommunications system that connects phones to telco networks through radio connections including base stations, antennas, chips and controllers. Besides Huawei, the RAN business, (which is about $76 billion in annual sales,) is dominated by Samsung (Korean), Ericsson (Swedish), Nokia (Finnish) and ZTE (also Chinese and also at loggerheads with the U.S. government.)

The Trump administration at first began telling allies in Europe that buying Huawei technology posed a national security risk, though with no hard evidence. That gained little traction. “The message was ‘trust us,’ but that is not a strong suit from this administration,” says an industry source. But what if the argument was framed in terms of economics, this source continued. If Huawei and ZTE gain more and more market share then the non-Chinese suppliers, which like all companies in the sectors need to spend billions of dollars of capital .
Trump’s early approach was to bully and threaten U.S. allies like Germany and the UK to abandon Huawei.   It didn’t quite work. And when the Trump administration has blocked the export of U.S. tech to China, the Chinese have responded maybe not the way Trump anticipated. “Rather than confront any U.S. restrictions, what they’ve basically done is make stronger efforts to try to reduce reliance on imported technologies, particularly U.S. ones. That seems to be part of the broader multi-year strategy that they’re implementing,” says Bruce Kasman, chief economist and managing director of global research at JPMorgan Chase.
And the Trump administration has moved to ban TikTok, which now has 80 million-plus monthly active users in the U.S. A key bone of contention here: Money, money, money. that,      this is a rivalry which will define societies; education, culture, the military,     and in the end personal freedom and responsibility.",juejmd,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/juejmd/usachina_new_digital_cold_war/

74,"Aerial 3D holograms a.k.a Plasma holograms in mid-air. Yes, like in Star Wars!","So a development and a potential implementation of aerial (plasma) holograms was in my mind for quite some time and I’ve managed to dig up just a couple of articles on that matter. One about [Aerial Burton](https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/15/aerial-3d-amazing-system-shows-3d-objects-in-mid-air-with-no-screen-video/) and their Aerial 3D holos.
One about [DNG (Digital Nature Group)](https://digitalnature.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp/2015/06/fairy-lights-in-femtoseconds/) with their “fairy lights” powered by femtosecond laser and spatial light modulator.

The latter is far more detailed and received a wider coverage in media back in 2015, however they seemed to move past their holos research into 3D printing and other fields. Burton guys seem to completely abandon their website, however, judging by what’s still there, I can see their technology is much different and doesn’t use femtosecond lasers. They call it plasma laser but it’s not clear what this actually means. Any ideas here?
Burton’s tech also seems more compact -> [Link](http://www.burton-jp.com/en/producten.htm).

To conclude, it seems to me this laser hologram tech has enormous potential (given it will be developed) but both groups haven’t given any updates. Have you heard of any news/researches beside these two? I will be happy to get any hints for my own further research.

Also the exact naming of such thing is yet to be established, so be happy to offer your options 👍",jyt5g6,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/jyt5g6/aerial_3d_holograms_aka_plasma_holograms_in/

147,"How different or similar to/from today was the world of multiple competing architectures & formats like C64, Amiga, Atari, IBM-PC, etc; & even Betamax vs VHS?","As someone born in the mid-1980s, I have little recollection of some of the various format wars & competition among different standards & architectures that consumers hoping to buy into a general category (say computers, or the VCR). What was it like in practice? Was it anything like we have today with smartphone platforms or videogame consoles? Can it be said that having one/very little dominant platforms in whatever category we're speaking of has made things better for everyone? For instance, I & likely plenty of other people personally am saddened that webOS & MeeGo are virtually done for & despite other OS like Jolla Sailfish, FirefoxOS, BB 10, Windows Phone, Ubuntu Phone, etc coming about, it looks like in the smartphone world, the common platforms have been decided to where people will jump into this world buying either iOS or Android, no matter how good something else may be.

Is it usually true that in such format/standard wars, that neither the most open nor most technologically superior standard wins out?

Does anyone else wonder about alternate paths reality could've taken where video, smartphone, & computing platforms these days could've ended up similar to videogame consoles - competition but still having a health industry as a whole, where everyone innovates & the good/best ideas become common practices?

If anyone here lived through the Betamax vs VHS tape war & the computing world of about the same timeframe, how was it for you? Did you get frustrated because your favourite title may end up on the platform you didn't have? Did you see the advantages & disadvantages of the existence of the various systems?

Update Addition: Question for Linux users: Do you like the amazing amount of choice in many aspects of your computing experience that other platforms don' t seems to have? Is it a double-edged sword?

274,"Germany’s imminent decision on Huawei, does it matter? (Opinion)","I keep up on world events and it’s drawn my attention that Germany will soon be deciding what path to take regarding the degree to which Huawei building it’s 5G infrastructure. I would suggest it is in the best interest of Germany, the United States and much of the world that Huawei not be trusted to build the networks our governments and corporations use to share information. The best way to mitigate this sort of espionage risk is to avoid Huawei telecommunications gear entirely.

Huawei has for some time been criticized for being under control of the CCP and recently the Pentagon let it be known to the public that the PLA controls Huawei. Any party Germany works with is exposed to having its corporate and government secrets handed over to China if Germany allows their information to pass through Huawei telecommunications gear. I personally know someone who’s company had their product and brand itself counterfeited in China. Corporate espionage facilitated by China accounts for hundreds of billions in IP theft a year. At the same time other government targets of spying suffer similar fates with costs being hard to measure. 

It is said that depending on the state, dropping Huawei could cost a couple billion and China is also threatening retaliation. Most of us are seeing that every year the carrots China’s offering shrink and the stick gets bigger. That makes a tough choice, but those costs must be compared to the ongoing risks Huawei would pose. Germany would be one of the last big players to stand up to the CCP and Huawei, benefitting them and those who share information with. Their approach could be a model for other states to follow as well. 

Some say the US has similar capabilities as China, but it’s China that is actively using these tools to steal IP. As far as other forms of spying, every country engages in espionage and every country has the prerogative to resist it. Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Axel Springer SE, the parent company of Insider Inc. recently compared trusting the US verses China as choosing between an imperfect democracy or a perfect dictatorship.

Taking a step back from this specific issue, China does not allow their people representation in government, free speech, and distrusts them to the point of coupling extensive censorship with propaganda. The rest of the world is finding out the CCP does not intend to treat us with any more regard than their own people, engaging in numerous grey zone activities. Huawei isn’t alone the most serious issue in the world, but when combined by the other behaviors and capabilities China has been developing recently it is more than troubling.

If Germany chooses to stand up to Huawei and the CCP I am confident it would be in everyone’s best interest

275,Why Google is Full of Crap about logging in from a recognized device,"A few days ago, I was working in an open computer lab. The computer was completely turned off. I booted it, opened up the browser, went to the Google page and clicked on Gmail. Someone else's email inbox opened.

I logged out of it and tried to log into my own email only to get the message that ""for my own security"" I couldn't log in because the device I was logging in from wasn't recognized.

So they don't log out of the session when the browser closes, even when the computer shuts down, to allow for the possibility of another user; but they locked me out of my account because I wasn't logging in from my phone, laptop it tablet, none of which I had with me.

Was not happy. Switching to another web based mail.

278,Is there a use for location services in social media?,"After only recently watching Jack Vale’s social media prank, in which he uses location services to find information about random people in public, it has intrigued me how much location services/sharing your location is actually useful?


As proved in Jack’s video, many users do not turn off location services when posting to sites such as instagram and twitter. Any person can do a simple search for “tweets near me” and are instantly able to pick a location and see what the tweet was, who tweeted it, where it was and what time it was. 



In some ways it can be seen as just another advancement of social media - adding another option for us to put our current ‘status’ out to our friends, to promote further engagement and interaction through commonalities or opinions of what was posted. 


**BUT**




As social media is continuing to exponentially grow, (with more platforms becoming popular in more places everyday) is it just providing us with an ‘extra’ setting that we may want to turn off?

Invasion of privacy has no doubt been a massive talking point in recent years in light of Snowden, Wikileaks etc. By having location services available in social media are we as users essentially ‘asking for it’ in some retrospects. Although we cannot do much to stop governments/large websites collecting information about us, a smaller scaled notion of ‘social spying’ I think will become more prevalent in years to come if it continues to be used while as a society we are becoming more *‘internet bred’*. As society progresses further into social media interaction from an earlier and earlier age it may bring one of 2 instances;


a) we become lazier in terms of our online privacy adopting the notion of ‘who ever looks/uses that anyway’.



b) we become more vigilant and actually delve into what our own personal use of these settings/services are, and whether they are necessary or not us.




I think the latter has occurred in the last few years with the whistleblowing and large scale privacy invasion being brought to the eye of the public, however I wonder what we would be like if Wikileaks, Snowden, etc, were not in the picture. I think we as a society that is continually becoming technology reliant need to take a more active role in actually assessing our own situation first, rather than letting waiting for information about this coming out in the media, which generally by this time is too late!



Personally, I do not really find much use of the location services. In a way, I can see it being useful in a context such as:

‘X is at the Bean Cafe’

“X: The best coffee I’ve had, everyone should come and try this place.”



But what difference does this have than posting it on the Bean Cafe’s wall as a review, rather than sharing your current location to everyone else?



It is not government’s that care for this kind of information but it could be a means of criminals, stalkers and predators of knowing where you are…in real time!



My stance is that there is really not much use for location services in **personal** social media use. And by using them we are opening ourselves up for a greater invasion of privacy.

Do you think that having location services available is something that we as a society should be embracing or is it making social media become 'too personal’?   

**tl;dr:**
Do location services present in social media have any real personal use?

AGs from 48 states and territories filed the notice of appeal one month [after a judge dismissed their complaint](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/28/judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint-against-facebook.html) and that of the Federal Trade Commission.

“We filed this notice of appeal because we disagree with the court’s decision and must hold Facebook accountable for stifling competition, reducing innovation, and cutting privacy protections,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who led the bipartisan coalition, in a statement Wednesday. “We can no longer allow Facebook to profit off of exploiting consumer data.”

Though the judge gave the FTC, which filed a similar lawsuit against Facebook, another chance to amend and re-file its complaint, he did not provide the same recourse for the state plaintiffs. The judge said the states’ long delay to challenge the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp was unprecedented at that level.",oy100c,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/oy100c/state_ags_plan_to_fight_court_dismissal_of_their/

468,[META] Your weekly reminder of what the difference is between here and /r/technology,"http://i.imgur.com/KfYE9bP.png

Have you heard of our Lord and Savior Net Neutrality?  Are you *sure*?  Are you *really sure*?

By the way people, **this** is why we want to only allow the one stickied thread on the subject.  This news is Reddit's hot story, and since it's tangentially related to technology it's allowed there.  A month from now there will be another hot story with great titlebait links that plasters the front of every sub that allows news. 

Stressed out admins counts at ""pure tech""... somehow.  Pretty much sums up the state of that sub.

The completely false story about /r/technology, ON /r/technology, is a nice ending. Now let's compare...

Damn, that's a beefy solar plant (molten salt plants are awesome).  Look, a spacesuit (no really, look, it's pretty ridiculous).  Artificial leaves?  Tiny satellites? And below my cutoff we have a computer that argues, a 3-D printed house, and some other good stuff.

Here's my vision for /r/tech: the technology equivalent to /r/science.  Whereas /r/science is about new scientific results from studies/experimentation, /r/tech should be about novel and awesome innovation. That's what it looks like it's heading towards, and I hope we keep it that way.  Not whether Johnny Handjob of the Fuckall committee said three words about net neutrality.

488,"Germany’s imminent decision on Huawei, does it matter? (Opinion)","I keep up on world events and it’s drawn my attention that Germany will soon be deciding what path to take regarding the degree to which Huawei building it’s 5G infrastructure. I would suggest it is in the best interest of Germany, the United States and much of the world that Huawei not be trusted to build the networks our governments and corporations use to share information. The best way to mitigate this sort of espionage risk is to avoid Huawei telecommunications gear entirely.

Huawei has for some time been criticized for being under control of the CCP and recently the Pentagon let it be known to the public that the PLA controls Huawei. Any party Germany works with is exposed to having its corporate and government secrets handed over to China if Germany allows their information to pass through Huawei telecommunications gear. I personally know someone who’s company had their product and brand itself counterfeited in China. Corporate espionage facilitated by China accounts for hundreds of billions in IP theft a year. At the same time other government targets of spying suffer similar fates with costs being hard to measure. 

It is said that depending on the state, dropping Huawei could cost a couple billion and China is also threatening retaliation. Most of us are seeing that every year the carrots China’s offering shrink and the stick gets bigger. That makes a tough choice, but those costs must be compared to the ongoing risks Huawei would pose. Germany would be one of the last big players to stand up to the CCP and Huawei, benefitting them and those who share information with. Their approach could be a model for other states to follow as well. 

Some say the US has similar capabilities as China, but it’s China that is actively using these tools to steal IP. As far as other forms of spying, every country engages in espionage and every country has the prerogative to resist it. Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Axel Springer SE, the parent company of Insider Inc. recently compared trusting the US verses China as choosing between an imperfect democracy or a perfect dictatorship.

Taking a step back from this specific issue, China does not allow their people representation in government, free speech, and distrusts them to the point of coupling extensive censorship with propaganda. The rest of the world is finding out the CCP does not intend to treat us with any more regard than their own people, engaging in numerous grey zone activities. Huawei isn’t alone the most serious issue in the world, but when combined by the other behaviors and capabilities China has been developing recently it is more than troubling.

If Germany chooses to stand up to Huawei and the CCP I am confident it would be in everyone’s best interest

I've had nothing but android my whole life, never owned an iPhone. That being said, I don't necessarily think it's fair to say ""android is better than iPhone""; preference exists. A tech savvy individual most of the time may prefer an Android because they're more complex and customizable, and that's what tech savvy people enjoy, whereas the average consumer that isn't necessarily into tech as much, may prefer a more simple phone that does what you need and looks good.

Technology is one of my favorite things; I very much enjoy keeping up with the latest tech and learning more about them. Android is my preference, but I don't trash talk iPhones because I cannot force someone to like what I like. I actually think iPhones are nice. They look good, feel good. Pretty cool phone.

I want to get him a VPN service that will connect him into the states. I am guessing he has about 2Mb down and around 768k upload, so something with that much overhead should be ok.

I just need to make sure that this VPN provider is not also blocked, so they need to be large enough that they have implemented a number of servers to deal with the cat and mouse game.

Not looking for a free service, but would not be objectionable.  Also, this is not for privacy, this is just to get around the blocking laws.  I am sure they offer 128 and higher crypto, but in this case, that is a plus, but not at all needed.

At face value, this is exactly the type of behavior his Net Neutrality rules were designed to stop. However, Binge On allows any content provider to be included in the list as long as they fashion their video to meet T-Mobile's technical specifications. The videos can't be streamed via HTTPS (this way T-Mo can compress it), and there are some other provider-side changes. They're all pretty minor, for most providers. 

The fact that T-Mo is being so nondiscriminatory is why he likes it. John even stated porn providers would be allowed onto the list if they work with T-Mobile to meet the necessary specifications.",3tkiid,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/3tkiid/why_tom_wheeler_likes_tmobiles_binge_on/
530,The Mars Society's University Rover Challenge Documentary,"Each year, student engineering teams from around the world immerse themselves in designing, building, and testing the next generation of Mars Rovers. University students from different engineering disciplines (mechanical, electrical, software) and science backgrounds, spend 12 months of the year preparing for the annual University Rover Challenge competition at the Mars Desert Research Station in Hanksville, Utah United States. In this grueling Mars-like environment, they test their student-built rover and themselves in a series of events such as traversing, remote scientific analysis, and retrieval and manipulation. Now in its 10th year, this challenging event has proved to be extremely rewarding for the students as individuals, but also benefits the entire field of space exploration by stimulating technical innovation and inspiring the next generation of talent who will take us forward.

You can check out the following documentary video which was produced by Protocase https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CWQlNNEotA , as a way to raise awareness of this entry point for space exploration, for students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) education, and to showcase the experience these university students receive, as they create technology that may one day work alongside human explorers in the field.

The video was premiered at the 19th Annual Mars Society Convention back in September. This four-day event brought together leading scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and government officials to address the significance of the latest in scientific discoveries and technological advances. Key discussions for the event included “how close are humans to stepping on Mars, and what technological advances are needed to make this happen?” Along with presentations from NASA and the Canadian Space Agency, The Mars Society’s Robert Zubrin also addressed the audience to close the convention. This setting was a perfect fit to showcase the documentary as these students involved in the video will aspire to be interns and full-time employees at most of the space organizations in attendance watching. All in all, it was a great two weeks for space as Elon Musk also announced his Mar’s colonization plans the following week.

For an audience who really appreciates advances in technology, what technology do you feel the students could be adapting that may help design a more functional Mars Rover? Any ideas will gladly be presented to the URC team and communicated to all teams for next year's event.

For more information on the University Rover Challenge event, have a look at urc.marssociety.org or check out more URC Mars Rovers videos at: http://www.protocase.com/about/sponsorship/rover-challenge.php

531,"Please, please help me kill the robo calls.","I am ready give up my land line. I am home all day and I get 5+ calls a day from telemarketers. Now the local politicians have added to the annoyance. The do not call (DNC) registry is a joke.

Is there a phone system that does not ring until certain requirements are met?

1. Keep a data base of OK’ed phone numbers so those calls goes straight through.
2. Allow me to record a message (stating that violators of the do not call list will be reported to the government).
3. Record the phone number, date and time (not requiring caller ID would be nice).
4. Require a person to enter X number of digits code (would like 2 digets) then my phone would ring.

That would be ideal. I’d pay big bucks just for #4. That would kill all the robo calls. Banana phone and Nomorobo will not work for me.

532,Impact & Understanding of (Nvidia’s) Denoiser on the Movie Industry,"Hey Reddit,

I recently saw a few article about Denoisers (-> e.g Nvidia Denoiser in OptiX, or the V-Ray Denoiser [1], [2], [3]), and I am super impressed by the technology and would love to learn more about it.

I am especially interested in where it can be applied, which devices you need for it, and its impact on the film industry. For instance, does drastically reduced render-times mean **we can expect shorter time-periods between high-quality movies?** 😃

Would be cool if you could help me in my search for answers. Plus, please be a little forgiving, I’m not too deep into the technical material :S   (just some dude who is generally impressed by it)


Here are my thoughts: 

1. Is the Denoiser ‘only’ good enough for previews (-> fast work iterations), or is it also used in the final render pass of the movie? (which output we see in the cinema)

2. If it would be good enough for the final pass, does that imply the movie industry can produce their animated films much faster now? And thus, we should expect more animated movies coming out soon? (looking at you @ Pixar 😃)

3. Do we need a GPU do use the Denoiser, or does it work with CPUs as well? I suspect it is neural-network inference, and thus should work on both devices? (if not: please provide some details)

4. Does the Denoiser work on ‘all’ render scenes that use path tracing ( ray tracing and/or radiance)? Moreover, which segments does this include? (Animation movies? Action film? GCI? Cartoons? Anime?) 

5. Do all modern render-engines have their own Denoiser? If so: Which one would you say is currently the state-of-the-art? 


Thanks a lot !

533,[Discussion] Portrayal of Artificial Intelligence in Media,"Media sensationalizing stories is hardly news, but I wanted to see what all you guys' opinion on how a lot of media presents a distorted image on the current state of artificial intelligence and what effects that would have on society and their perception of the field.

From what I've seen of articles talking about artificial intelligence, many paint the image that every major tech company has a skynet within their system that is a living being on the verge of self awareness and will take over the world. They address AI programs as living beings with thoughts. And even the companies that are AI developers seem to advertise it as such. One major example being the ads for IBM Watson.

One particular example that I find is the epitome of this kind of journalism is this article: http://www.ntd.tv/2017/07/31/facebook-kills-ai-that-made-its-own-language-here-are-5-times-ai-got-creepy/

My biggest problem with this article specifically is that the AI's ""new language"" is most likely a mistake. What is probably happening is the AI is finding patterns in the English language that just aren't the standard rules for English grammar. Yet the media repackages it as a creepy development that means robots will kill us all.

In my experience with AI, we are nowhere near the singularity and are, in fact, pretty idiotic. They have trouble performing tasks that are much simpler than self awareness. However, my knowledge of AI is restricted to a bunch of novelty projects I've seen around the internet and my personal experience using neural networks for projects. I'd like to see what all of your opinions might be.",6vnz3m,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/6vnz3m/discussion_portrayal_of_artificial_intelligence/
534,Imessage is the biggest reason I'm wary of switching from my Iphone.,"So I'm an 18 year old girl, in college (though out for summer), and so most of my friends use iMessage. I literally can count the people who don't on one hand, and none of them are the people I talk to most frequently. I'm not one of those crazy people who will block an android user just not to see green bubbles, but I have noticed that texting is far more annoying even when just texting a friend who's an android user (missed messages, incomplete messages, etc). I know there are messenger apps like Kik and WhatsApp, but at least in my social circle, nobody uses them for day to day easy texting! 

&#x200B;

I really love the design of the Google Pixel 3, because it reminds me of the same feeling I got when my first iPhone (4S) came out and everything was new and fun and innovative. I'm not deep into the apple ecosystem at all (refused to get anything other than a PC because I love gaming and I'm learning code, besides I grew up on windows) but I do feel kind of stuck with Apple. Prices for the new iPhones seem super crazy, especially since this will be the first year I buy my own phone (I hope this doesn't make me sound spoiled I'm just trying to show you guys everything that's going on) and $1,000 is a shit ton when the only jobs I can get for the moment are a little above minimum wage in my state ($7.25/h). Yes, I could save up for it...but I don't want to feel stuck when buying a new phone man. 

&#x200B;

Imessage is by far my favorite part of my apple device. I'm a big texter, and easily sharing photos and videos in good quality is nice. Groupchats are important asf in college, and while a lot of them are on Groupme, there are considerable amounts made by smaller groups (ex: my business school team chat). I've actually seen people go out of their way to exclude android users in these situations, making one groupchat for the person with the android so they can see important messages and then making an iphone groupchat to joke around and stuff in with vids and photos easily as well as configure groupchat settings itself. I suppose it could be FOMO, but it sucks when the FOMO is also kind of important for maintaining connections with everyone whether they're a best friend, a friend, or an acquaintance you're just getting to know.

&#x200B;

What do you guys think I should do, and what other options can I consider? I'd  appreciate any advice, and thank y'all in advance, have a lovely rest of your day\~",bqmidm,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/bqmidm/imessage_is_the_biggest_reason_im_wary_of/

* Detection elephants in Assam, India.
* Detection carnivores (Polar Bears, Tigers).

The system should be easy to setup by locals, locally sourced, climate proof, low maintenance and easy scalable. Besides that, because of the sensitivity of the location data (poachers do like locations of tigers). It should be secure.

633,About H1-B Programmers and Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Companies - my experience,"I have been a frequent reader of this sub, and I always found it fascinating to read stories and discussions on H1-B program or H1-B programmers here. Having been on the other side of this story, I found some of it to be truthful, some wrong, some dishonest, and most of it to be stereotypical. In most cases, the participation has always been one sided, so I thought I should share my point of view. This is not an effort to convince anyone of anything - this is about what I experienced as an H1-B migrant. Yes, I will try to make some points on what I believe to be misconceptions, but I am not writing this in defense of anything.

This may become a long post - apologies in advance if it's not your style.

----------------------

A little bit on my H1-B journey: I am from India. I hold Bachelor of Engineering (undergrad) degree - but not in Computer Science. Right after my undergrad, I was picked up by one of those 'famous' Indian giant companies to be a software engineer. I was trained for 3 months in some very basic subjects of C, Unix, Databases etc. Then we did some mock projects mocking a real system and eventually started working on a real but small project where real learnings happened. I was fortunate to work with some really bright computer engineers/programmers and learned a lot that helps me even today. Eventually, I made it to the USA on H1-B program. Since then, I have been in this country for more than 10 years, have become US citizen, have a great family and a nice job. I love technology in general and programming in particular. I travel around the country whenever I get a chance. It's been good so far.

----------------------

Here is my take on things I have read here or somewhere else on the contentious subject of H1-B:

## On The Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Company:
Companies such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS are not just supplying bodies to the Evil American Corporation. They take up small/big projects (may be maintenance or support project, or may be a bigger product/feature/website development project). They have some people on-site, but many more people offshore working on programming/development/coding/testing.
At the same time, in a lot of cases, they could provide people to work on a client site merely as another software engineer for the client. But that’s not what makes them money, and they don’t really prefer doing it.

Most of their clients are medium to large to enterprise companies. There are some technology companies too, but big retail chains, big new york banks etc are more typical clients.
They recruit freshers in big numbers. Train them for a short time in basics of programming and then are allocated to work on real projects. For a while, they perform less important/less critical tasks. But the real education do happen on these projects. They eventually become good enough to start being productive. (Those without any competence are either let go, or - if they somehow manage to wing it for a year or two - will become managers. Yes.)

These places are not easy to work at. A lot of competition. Typical rat race. To move up the ladder, you have to be a very good programmer (and a very good talker) or have a very good godfather manager to take care of you. In most cases, people don’t want to be a better programmer or learn new technologies or want to continue on technical stream. They want to become manager (project manager, product manager, bullshit manager, real manager - whatever). I think this happens because most of the employees are not naturally good at programming. They just happen to be in IT because that’s what pays.

Having said that, a really good techie can make a very successful career, if he/she is equally good at selling himself/herself. At the same time, a good programmer who isn’t good at selling himself can go through the process hell where nobody gives shit about his talents and loses creativity, passion and love for technology. Really good ones will know this early on and move out to a real technology company.

These companies have processes in place. A lot of it actually. There are a billion documents to prepare, a million of audits to go through, and a thousand standards to be certified with. While having some processes in place is a good thing, these places are nightmares for those who want to just program. They process the shit out of everybody and everything.

These companies do have some good programmers working for them. I have worked with some truly talented people. They understand tenets, nuances and principles of programming/software engineering and use it brilliantly. They are as good as a good programmer you may find in the US or anywhere. But they are not the norm. Most of the programmers are average. They follow the orders, churn out code as per requirements. They just want to get their paychecks, move up the ladder as fast as they can so they don’t have to code anymore.


## On Salaries and Doing Things Illegally:

These companies, contrary to popular belief, do not really try anything illegal.
In the past, they might have bent the rules like sending somebody onsite to do real work on business visa (a strict no-no), but those were exceptions then and almost never happen nowadays.

They do not pay that badly. Yes, they are not going to be paying top money, but their salaries are dictated by the laws where they can’t really exploit their employees. E.g. Around 10 years back, say a guy with 4-6 years of experience in software development might have been paid 70-80k salary working in, say, north-east region.

They do not take away anyone’s passport. Never. (This actually happens a lot with those small companies who basically promise H1-B to a lot of unfortunate graduates in India for a hefty commission, and almost everything they do is illegal, but this is definitely not true for big established companies like Infosys, TCS, CTS etc.)

They can’t and don’t prevent people from leaving and switching their employers. They try to retain such people, but not illegally - like taking their passports away or threatening them.

## On Going Onsite (or Nirvana!):

Once you win H1-B lottery, the company will try ASAP to place you on-site in the states. That’s because there is a limited number of people with this visa, and there is a huge demand for them to be on-site - as project coordinators, as client-site development/maintenance/support team member, or in some cases purely to add another person to client development team.
Also this is a wet dream of any Indian programmer working for these companies. The Purpose of Life. The Ultimate Goal. Nirvana. Whatever you call it.

They will board a flight, find other coworkers already settled at the destination city, arrange for a short term accommodation with them or with their help. In most cases, these companies have large number of people already onsite. So for a newcomer, it’s easy to settle in. In cases where the client is in the town of Bumblefuck and there is nobody there they know, people will still figure things out and be the torchbearer for next set of incoming people. Indians are crafty enough to figure things out.

For most people, they have two end goals for their Trip to the USA - either settle here for good, or make enough money to buy a very expensive apartment in Bangalore. So they wish for a long term project. Some people are sent only for short terms, but they too return back eventually for long term.

Few of them struggle and find difficult to adjust to new country, new culture and new people - but most of them are flexible enough to be able to continue living for long time.
These companies are reluctant to file for green-cards because it's expensive to do so, but they do it for a minority of H1-B employees. If you have a good clout or a friendly manager, are good at talking, or are critical to a project, companies most likely will do it for you, but it’s not easy.

Those who are still not married or are traveling without family share accommodations - this maximizes their savings, and they don’t mind sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with three other people. India is a country of a lot of people, and we are used to be around lot of people. Granted, some of these apartments are small and crowded, but most of these people have absolutely no problem with it.

A lof of H1-B migrants do not mix well with local people, or culture. They will form their own groups within and without the office space. If there are large number of other people from their mother company at client site, they will stick to each other, go for lunches together in big groups. If and when they become comfortable at client site, they will also start behaving with more freedom and less professionally - which means talking and laughing loudly in their groups, speaking in their mother-tongues etc. They will stick to eating Indian food most/all the time. Most of them are not adventurous enough to try new cuisine. Well, other than Dominoe's. They stick to watching Indian movies. Of course they will also watch Hollywood blockbusters, but they don’t explore anything other than mainstream movies. They have absolutely no idea about local music pubs, arts or museums.
They like big breaks for tea/coffee and spend time on silly talks. That’s because a lot of them have no family and have no life outside work.
They spend hours at office. Even after they go home, they will have calls with offshore teams that can last until midnight.
Did I mention most of them have no life outside work? They don’t.
Some people are good at programming and technology, and they will stand out among other average people. If they are adventurous enough, they will get a decent job (since H1-B allows people to switch jobs). But most of them never consider that option because they have average programming skills.

## My own experience as H1-B programmer:
My first project was for a big bank, where I started on the project at off-shore, in India, and was eventually sent onsite when I had my H1-B.

It was a charged environment where there was already a lot of anger against people like me among the programmers and other employees at the client company. I didn’t know any of that, until I started noticing odd behaviors of people. (Note: People on H1 visa at the client site are almost always treated as second class citizens - partially because they don’t try to mix well with local employees, partially because of a huge cultural divide, but mainly because they are a threat to local employment. Even when there isn't any loss of jobs with local employees, they are always suspicious. I don’t find this surprising, but it’s not a good experience for any of the two parties.)

I moved onto a different client, different team, had a much pleasant experience, was welcome to the client team, but always worked on shitty projects. I did my best in whatever work I did, impressed my colleagues and client managers and kept at it - until I got a green-card (not through my employer, but with a different route of family sponsorship).

I quit as soon as I could, found a much better job with more challenging and satisfying work, and haven’t looked back since.

I consider myself a very good programmer, have loved doing what I do and would wnat to continue doing it for as long as I can. My job pays well, I have traveled a lot, have made many friends from all parts of life, and have settled in well.

I find this country and people to be very friendly, very accommodating and fun. There are a thousand things to do outside work, and I engage in a lot of them.

I can go on, but I think this should give some idea of life of H1-B programmers and the Evil Indian Companies who send them here.

I can answer questions if people are interested. I will stick to what I know as objectively as possible, but in the end, they are just my opinions and my experience.

-----------------

*TLDR*: Big Indian Outsourcing Tech Companies are not as evil as they are made out to be. A typical H1-B programmer from India is most likely average at his/her work. Some are really good at their work. I was one of these programmers. I have done pretty well overall - have settled down here for good and love being a programmer working with cool people.

721,The equivalent of one second for a machine," Is it correct to say:

1 second for a computer with a 2.4GHZ processor is equivalent to

F = 1 / T with F = 2.4GhZ then T = 1 / (2.4 \* 10 \^ 9) = 0.0000000024s

So for 1s => 0.0000000024s

1 / 0.0000000024 = 416 666 666.666 sec

or  416 666 666.666 / 60 = 6,944,444 min

or 6,944,444 / 60 = 115,740,740 hours

or 115,740,740 / 24 = 4,822.53 days

or 4822.53 / 365 = 13.21 years

It decodes specific signals in the brain that convert our thoughts into words.

The outcome of this research could lead to are endless opportunities, such as creating a system that could help severely paralysed people speak.

It could help people using hearing aids by amplifying the voice they want to listen to and block out any background noise. To understand what the listener wants to hear it uses electrodes placed on the section of the brain that processes sound (auditory cortex) 

Researchers then created a deep-learning algorithm that was trained to differentiate voices and look for the closest match between the electrical signature. once the algorithm choice has been made the hearing aid would amplify the voice that matches best with an average accuracy of 91%",bs3y3f,3,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/bs3y3f/algorithms_strike_again_you_might_soon_be_able_to/

Whatever happens in Russia and Ukraine, democracies won't be safe until the Big Tech business model is rewritten to one that doesn't profit by  misinformation, outrage, and personal data.

We of course also need to take into account the physical size of the core. I assume at a certain point, you lose speed because the core is just to big. So where do you think is that point ?

Could we for example see something like 12GHz on a single core ? 

Or is the sky the limit and we could, with a big cooling solution, see 20GHz on a core ?

&#x200B;

From what i have been able to read, there is no limit in terms of how fast you can make the Core. The limit comes from different stuff such as the Memory. A 12Ghz Core is all but worthless if you dont have Memory that can keep up.  
Not to mention the heat that would build up. Transistor size is also important. We are at around 7nm right now and some companys plan to reach 3nm by 2022. How much that plays into it i am not sure.

I know it's a bit unreal at the moment but Intel's testing it's skylake CPUs on phones and you'll have smartphones run full windows 10 X86-64 bits next year. It'll probably do anythink I do with my ultrabook at the moment, just plug my phone to an empty laptop via a USB type-C cord.

With somethink cheaper and even slimmer, lighter, longer battery life than a new macbook 12"", I can't see why people need ultrabooks anymore.

More serious laptops for more serious tasks can't be replaced anytime soon though.

1085,Rant on INVISIBLE SELFIE CAMERAS ... and What They SHOULD BE Focusing on instead!,"**Anyone else pissed at the fact that mega corporations have been spending their time, money and human resource on this superficial tech for the past 5+ years ??? .** Jesus Christ!! All this JUST SO THAT WE CAN TAKE A SELFIE. ??  Stop telling us that *'this is advancement in mobile technology'.*  Who asked for this? Who???? You are just creating artificial Needs and Wants ! You are shoving this down our throats. **Even for a die hard selfie addict this tech will NOT change their experience.** Next year, smartphones companies will have this on their flagship, and demand a frigging premium price for it while ignoring stuffs which THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON.

Here are so areas i wish phone companies spent their time and resources on. Now dont tell me these are *'difficult and too challenging*' . Tech companies can do the unimaginable if they are motivated enough. So, the stuffs i would like them to focus on are

1. **Display tech that does not strain the eyes.** Yes, please think about our health. How about an anti glare anti UV or what not eye protection tech. Changing the color temp to warm only helps us to a limited extent. Add another layer within LCD Display which will have that digital ink thingie. When we wanna simply read stuffs, it will be like a Amazon Kindle. When we wanna watch videos and play games, we switch back to color display. We have OLED technology, how about me merge these two. Both these tech revolves around switching ON -OFF its pixels. Shouldn't be tough.
2.  ***Battery life***. I get it, thermodynamics and shit is a hindrance, but there are tested and proven successful technologies like S**olid State Lithium Ion, Gold Nano-Wire, Zinc-Air.**... and many more which i read about like 10+ years ago, in some tech magazine (yea, back when tech magazines was a thing). We all know that if companies pull these techs out of the universities and bring it to their labs and work on it, they can make these techs a reality for mass market consumption.
3. ***Use Periscope Lens for Selfie camera.*** This tech first appeared in Huawei P20, and now Oppo has adopted it. They use it for zoom function, but **how about we use it to divert the light from the front camera lens, and into the rear sensor.** They selfie camera would be just a light receiver. The real VIEWING and Processing of light will be done by the main rear camera . We can have a hardware toggle or software based toggle.
4. ***Use the rear panel of the phone as a Heat dissipater.*** This idea comes from the flat area in a computer processor, where we put thermal paste and attach a cooler. We cant have fans in phones, so just let the back panel of the phone act as something that can release the heat.  Imagine this scenario---, we have two CPUs, neither have a CPU Cooler attached. On CPU #1, we put a plastic/glass sheet on top . On CPU #2  we leave it open. Both will run hot, but CPU#1 will get hotter. This CPU#1 is what happens to our mobile phone SoC. Instead of confining it, how about we let its heat dissipation area be EXPOSED  through the rear? OK i may be wrong in the **physics** sense, but its  just my  layman idea.
5.  **BRING BEZELS BACK!**  Yeah, i said it. We need convenience and functionality. We need to be able to use our phones with the least **finger gymnastics.**  Who here enjoys using those curved displays on smartphones?? You have to be carefull how you hold the phone. WHY!!!! WHY DID WE MAKE THINGS HARDER FOR OURSELVES???If we bring bezels back, we can stop companies from wasting time on stupid  technologies like  IN-DISPLAY FINGER PRINT SCANNERS and NOTCH/PUNCH HOLE DISPLAYS and other techs which has ACTUALLY MADE OUR LIFE WORSE. Yes, you all may not see it, but our mobile phone **experience** has been degrading for the past few years. We are no longer able to do things we could do before, we need to realize that, we are brainwashed to believe that life is improved, when its not. INCONVENIENCE should never be called INNOVATION or FEATURE. We ranted on the '*innovations*' brought by Windows 7, so why cant we do the same for mobile tech??
6. **USER-REMOVABLE COMPONENTS.** I am sure you all see teardown videos of smartphones, on YT channels like JerryRigEverything. We want to do the same thing but with minimal tools and effort. The only thing stopping us from prying the components out are the adhesives. We had smartphones with removable batteries that were slimmer than the competition! Remember Galaxy S4 ? i owned that shit and i used it for 4 years because i could swap the battery, ALL ON MY OWN. Why do we still use *neanderthal technologies* like a GLUE in the 21st century?? Cant these tech companies come up with a solution that ensures components stay in place without GLUE??

I could go one and on, but i can see this RANT is already too long and ppl might get bored.

Somehow, we have saturated and softened the word innovation to a common businesses slang term that is associated with small marginal improvements. 


Radical true innovations are owed to a select few restless bold individuals who charge out into the unknown and blaze a trail for the rest of civilization to follow, that is if they succeed. 

Disruption must occur for Humanity to continue to progress. It is not easy, cute, or comfortable. People lose jobs, industries disappear, and companies die... to give brith to new jobs, industries, and companies.

We of course also need to take into account the physical size of the core. I assume at a certain point, you lose speed because the core is just to big. So where do you think is that point ?

Could we for example see something like 12GHz on a single core ? 

Or is the sky the limit and we could, with a big cooling solution, see 20GHz on a core ?

&#x200B;

From what i have been able to read, there is no limit in terms of how fast you can make the Core. The limit comes from different stuff such as the Memory. A 12Ghz Core is all but worthless if you dont have Memory that can keep up.  
Not to mention the heat that would build up. Transistor size is also important. We are at around 7nm right now and some companys plan to reach 3nm by 2022. How much that plays into it i am not sure.

Here’s  the  catch.... They can’t repair them in house because it’s Apple and  that’s  not something “genius’s” are trained for.   And they can’t fly  the  batteries to you or your computer to them, because batteries might   ""explode"" (their words)... So they have to ground ship  everything from point A to  point B.  The turn around time should only  take about 2 weeks.  If you  feel that you can’t be without your machine  for that long, you can  always take your computer with you, but you will  also lose your place  in the battery replacement que.

Keep  in mind that the “appointment” was scheduled 2 weeks in advance,  and  none of these fine-print factoids where mentioned earlier.

I read this article today and it made me sad how much effort Huawei is making just to stay alive as a company. The Huawei case has shown China is in an emergency situation that is as dire as not having a nuke while a Nuclear power is threatening.

US can destroy China's phone companies overseas business anytime by just switching off Google. Its not just appstore. Most Android apps rely on Google Play services. Chinese companies will be doomed without it.

US can force Taiwan or other companies to cutoff supplies to any Chinese company by threatening to put them into entity list. Again, this means even Samsung or TSMC might stop selling their chips. That will destroy these companies even at home.All Chinese phone, Laptop or any type electronics companies are under huge threat.

Huawei is trying to develop alternatives to Google services such as Maps library and Huawei Core to replace Google Play services. But can such effort be successful if Huawei is the only one using it?

Huawei will not be that successful when other chinese companies still use google apps and services. It will create unfair disadvantage for Huawei since most app makers will not have the incentive to support them when its only Huawei having a different platform. This is the same problem Windows phone faced and ultimately failed. And these other chinese companies like Xiaomi will not take the tough decision and sacrifices needed to get rid of US dependence as long as they are not also banned.

Can Huawei designed instruction set be successful if Xiaomi still uses ARM? No, sadly. it will be losing business massively.

Huawei laptop business is over due to Windows ban. Can a Huawei developed laptop with a different OS be ever successful even in China, when every other Chinese company makes laptop with windows? 

There should be a combined effort among these companies to create one common system used by all chinese companies. There should be a few powerful system companies for things like Chip instruction set, Operating sytem and Phone App store instead of the current separate effort by everyone at the same time that ultimately will fail due to fragmentation.

Chinese govt should make this effort to force these companies to make sacrifices now. There should be a requirement of using atleast 30% or whatever percentage of phones or laptops that must be released with a chinese made OS or chip or app store.  There should be effort to create companies for systems where all these phone or electronic companies will have joint ownership.

Companies will only focus on short term gains and ultimately lose. China must make effort to create a long term safety.

Huawei should not fight alone. Xiaomi and Oppo and others should help and create one Chinese alternative end-to-end system instead of fighting among each other.",dt7phx,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/dt7phx/china_is_making_a_huge_mistake_by_letting_huawei/

Yet with the NSA revelations and the ensuing push for privacy you would expect a backlash. We know Google reads our email and apparently our data is profitable to them, but do we care when they provide a reliable service? I've heard it postulated that the economics will eventually push everything to the cloud. Scary thought!

1185,Exsiccate - recurrent lossless compression algorithm,"Hi,

My friend and I are working for 10+ years on compression algorithm. It is for fun but it looks like we did come to a place that progressing further without outside help is not really possible. As we do not have any good idea what or how to improve this situation I have come here.

Purpose of Exsiccate is to compress file without losing information. As it is recurrent then you can take such compressed file and compress it again. Obviously there is a lot of limitations to such algorithm. It takes plenty of time for one run as our math-fu is week.

I tried to contact universities asking if I can sponsor research/master thesis/Phd/whatever that would give us the required math for all the operations. In most cases my email had been ignored. Now I am asking you how I can find someone who would be interested in developing some math for us? Is master/Phd right way, or we should just hire someone, then how I can hire someone for such a task?

It probably is very unclear what I am saying so to give illustration of the issue we have to make adding or subbing bilion times as we are just not able to formulate clear math solution that would allow us to first group same millions of operations and handle as multiplication and addition instead of million additions.

PS. I would like to actually see any reply, even if it is just a ""no idea, keep trying"" ;)

1186,Stupid Solar FREAKEN Roadways,"Do you understand anything about glass manufacturing? The cheapest way is to make large flat and very smooth sheets, and even this is still expensive and requires a huge amount of energy.

First you have to 'float' the glass over molten metal to achieve the gloss finish.

Secondly you have to cut those sheets into whatever size you need(straight lines and square angles are quickest, cheapest and produce less waste)

Thirdly you have to polish the sharp edges otherwise the glass will explode in the toughening plant

Fourthly you toughen the glass by [a]heating it in a huge(and very expensive) oven, then [b] cooling it gradually. This process hardens the outside of the glass, similar to the crust on a flapjack/brownie, but not the inside. This is why safety glass explodes into tiny pieces. 

got that?

Excellent, so now that the glass has been toughened, you have a very limited ability to polish(AKA:grind down) the glass before the integrity is lost and the glass explodes. 

The process to make uniform patterned panels is massively more expensive. You then still need to toughen the glass and then you can do other expensive processes to make the glass stronger. 

After all this, a busy and dusty road would cause the glass to wear down and lose its integrity and shatter within minutes. With each exploded panel the problem will be compounded and the road would turn to very expensive and very toxic gravel within seconds.",27h85w,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/27h85w/stupid_solar_freaken_roadways/

Suggestions?","I have what is probably the worst modem router ever invented by mankind, a Cisco LinkSys WAG120n. My dad bought it on a whim a few months ago and it's been annoying me since the first day I used it. It often drops connectivity to the internet entirely, it's slow (paired with my ISP which honestly makes me feel like I would be better off sending my internet traffic via snail mail). My MacBook (which is also a bit faulty on its own) will often just stop loading pages or slow down, until I turn the router off and back on again. Sometimes it'll just disconnect from it for no apparent reason. I am unable to download any file of a decent size because at some point (often when it's around 90%), my router will just say ""fuck it"" and drop the connection.  

I'd like to buy a modem router that is worth being called such. I use the internet for my work (I am a freelance web developer) and I can't really stand extreme lag and random drops if I need to do my job properly. I probably can't (currently) help the problems my ISP is causing me but I'd like to at least get a router that will not die on me every hour or so, is decently fast, and has a decent wifi signal.

1188,"""pirate radio"" style open source alternative internet/cellular grid","I want to get a gauge on how much support something like this would pull in. I have a completely new pc architecture that does what quantum computers are supposed to do, but without the hit or miss effects of random magnetic fluxuations - the way it is designed will make the open source network perform phenomenally without reaching the 1ghz range - the data transmission method for these PC's will turn a few bytes into a string that can make many, many gigabytes. 

My hope is that people will expand on the idea, stick with cb radio bands to avoid governmental b.s. without losing the advantages of multi gigahertz datastreaming via cellular/wireless internet.

The internet is just a bunch of interconnected servers/computers (given mac addresses within an ip address that acts sort of like a domain name) that are hooked together with wire - signals are relayed from one node/server/website to the next until the destination is reached and the whole handshake thing keeps the connection open.

I want the same idea applied to pirate ""cell towers""/cb transmitter and reciever stations, each tower is a node that acts as the general area's router that connects to other ""cb routing stations"" to make an open source network grid - each device must be assigned a domain name, maybe randomize the domain name each time the device is connected and that acts as the mac address. 

Each tower must have a domain name that is like the ip address - figure it as a large scale open source wifi router that is like a large local area network and the towers/routers are connected to eachother ad-hoc.

Please post some feedback and healthy discussion types of critiques that stick to the topic.",6f0fqn,7,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/6f0fqn/pirate_radio_style_open_source_alternative/
1189,More on How to Manage Employee BYOD Arrangements,"
Those who have been reading RTI’s blogs are familiar with the acronym, BYOD. In case you are unfamiliar with these letters, they stand for “bring your own device” – an increasingly popular employer strategy which allows employees to use their mobile device in the workplace.

Our earlier blog discussed some of the advantages and disadvantages of such a policy, the most obvious disadvantage being corporate’s inability to regular (or protect) a device that a) they did not purchase) and b) has incompatible technology and cannot be serviced by the firm’s IT department. 

Apart from making devices secure, our third blog, “An FYI on BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)” suggests that the devices should also be tamper-free and lock automatically when not in use.  In case they are not, a recent Redmond Channel Partner whitepaper mentioned how the fact that mobile device that is “easy to lose” exposes a company’s highly important and private data.

The solution of implementing a strategy of COPE (corporate owned, personally enabled) in the workplace addresses the above listed issues, but there remain other problems. For example, what if the user does not want to use/be responsible for two mobile devices? 

We Have the Solution

Tablets use growth is projected to surpass (and may currently surpass) PC use growth. If your employees seem to be attached at the hip to their iphone or tablet, Reliant Tech’s system of mobile monitoring - - one of several managed services currently offered - - is the missing link to your IT infrastructure. 

Reliant Tech can integrate remote mobile management and reporting solution with notifications for your IT infrastructure. This integration solution will prove fundamentally different and extremely powerful. With this approach, you will be able to enjoy compatible technology across the board, optimal security, and adaptability.

1190,Verizon EDGE: Can someone check my math and tell me why i'm wrong?,"I have read a lot of info on the Verizon Edge program which talks about how big of a scam this system is. Im crunching the numbers and having a hard time confirming this claim.

Verizon Edge allows customers to pay about $25/month in addition to their cellular and data plan in order to gain the ability to upgrade their device after 1 year. In the past, users paid 200 dollars up front for devices and Verizon hid $20/month in your service contract to cover the cost of the phone over the course of 2 years.

The claim that I see a lot is that EDGE is a scam because you are paying $25/month in addition to the $20 charge already baked into your service contract.  The claim is that you are being double charged.

Lets assume that you're buying an iPhone 5S 16GB which retails for $650

Old system- you pay $200 up front and Verizon hides $20/month into your service contract which lasts for two years
200+($20 X 24 months) = $680

EDGE program- you do not pay an upfront cost but are charged extra per month but gain the ability to get a new phone after 1 year without upgrade fees.  If you purchase an iPhone 5S 16GB this comes out to about $25/month for EDGE and $20/month in your service contract. This leads to a charge of $45/month for 1 year.
($45 X 12 months) = $540

It seems to me that this is similar to buying or leasing a car.  In the first case, you pay 200 up front and spread the rest of the cost over 2 years but own the car after those 2 years.  In the latter case, you pay more per month so that Verizon recoups their cost faster.  This allows you to upgrade your device after 1 year but you do not get to keep the device.

I have read so much calling this system a scam but it seems to me that you are paying a slight premium per month to gain the ability to upgrade after 1 year but lose the ability to keep the phone.

Where did I go wrong with my logic?!

1191,"Non-obvious learnings in launching current startup, after co-founding 2 startups that were acquired and 1 IPO","I posted on here before when we first launched, I wanted to update you guys on some of the learnings we’ve had.

I feel compelled to share this. I'm addicted to building products people want to use. Most people think that once you have a few wins under your belt, it's easy sailing for the next startup. I think that's only partly true. Here's some context and what I think of as non-obvious learnings.
I built my last venture-funded startup to $18M in revenue a year and was acquired. We then took the acquirer public (NYSE: TRMR). I'm now back building my next startup [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech). 
 
**Team-building** - This gets easier, as you know who the good people are at early stages and who you have chemistry with. However, if you work with the same people you have been successful with, the strengths of having the flow and chemistry sometimes might translate into the weakness of not being paranoid. You don’t want to be stuck on a certain wavelength of thinking and not add fresh blood into key conversations. I have seen this occasionally and it’s subtle. This way of thinking brought us success before, so it’ll work again this time. Not necessarily true. 
 
**Finding Product / Market fit** - Experience and calcified assumptions can be a bad thing. You tend to think less disruptively if you are not as wide-eyed. One of the learnings we had early on when starting the current company was to find a space with problems we were intimately familiar with as users and passionate about solving, but not a domain we knew much about in terms of how things were done. This way, we didn't feel shackled by assumptions. Our pain point for remote collaboration. We weren't as productive as we wanted to be on existing video conferencing systems. A lot of innovation was in supporting as many users as possible in a session. We thought for teams looking to get things done, there was little innovation in amplifying team's productivity. So we built [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech), a video conferencing platform with productivity tools on top. What was a bit non-obvious was that we have to reset ourselves to have a lot of humility in testing assumptions and re-building our network of contacts.
 
**Fund-raising** - This gets easier too since we are credible entrepreneurs with wins. That said, the surprising thing is sometimes we get questions around if we were too experienced and not wide-eyed enough. Raising too much money can turn into a downward spiral as you might be tempted to spend too much too quickly and lose the discipline that comes with a small budget.  
 
**Distribution Model** - This was probably the biggest learning. Our current business was very different than our last one. How we get to customers is extremely different. The times have also changed - how users buy certain types of software have also started to transition from field sales to inside sales and self-service. Getting up to speed here took time. We used to have a field sales driven organization that was expensive to build. Now, we are innovating on self-service to make cost of sales much lower. 
 
**Mindset** - This is probably the most important. Thematically, you just have to have a scrappy mindset again. You have to fight every dollar spent and get every dollar in. Question every assumption. Vet every investor and potential hire.
 
Overall, there’s a little grain of truth to the old line “the more experience you have, the less you know”, especially in a fast-changing segment. You just gotta keep your head steady and assume nothing.

1192,[Question] Trouble installing new OS on Windows 8 computer,"**You can skip down to the bottom if you want, I'll bold the question and any information that I think may be important** 
***
I have a laptop that was preinstalled with Windows 8. Once you learn the trackpad shortcuts and get used to the new start screen, it's actually far better than most people say it is; however, I still find it frustrating and want to change my OS. 

#I've downloaded the Ubuntu version 13.04 64 bit disk image and burned it to a CD-R. From the disk I ran `wubi.exe` and selected the normal computer reboot option, and during reboot the disk didn't even register. I tried again, this time selecting the ""Help me boot from CD"" option. This time, after reboot, after I clicked Ubuntu at the OS selection (it did register this time) Windows Bootup Manager gave me an error saying that it couldn't load the OS because it was missing the file. The complete error message was as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Starting Windows didn't succeed. The reason may be changing software.

    To solve this problem:
        1. Insert installation disc of Windows and reboot pc
        2. Choose language settings and click Next
        3. Use Repair

    If you don't own this disk contact with the administrator.

    File: \ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr
    State: 0xc000007b
    Information: Could not load application or Operating System because of the lack of the required file or errors in this file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I tried again and it gave me the same error message. I figured it either downloaded or burned wrong, so I downloaded the disk image again and made a LiveUSB out of it.

 Again, I had the same problem of it not registering after restart.

 Again, I tried the ""Help me boot from CD"" option. 

Again, I got the same missing `\ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr` error. 

Well, maybe it was just an error with the actual files in that version, it was only released about 2 months ago, it could still be buggy and they may not have been able to fix it yet. I downloaded the Ubuntu version 12.04 64 bit disk image this time instead of version 13.04 and burned it to a different CD-R. With high hopes I ran `wubi.exe` and during boot up, the disk didn't run. No surprise there. You know the drill by now. Again, the same dreaded missing `\ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr` error from Windows Bootup Manager. Sadly, the Ubuntu through-current-operating-system installer does not have support for Windows 8.

So by now I know that there's an issue, an issue far beyond the control whatever I could do with those CD's and USB, an issue far beyond the control of however I tried to run the installation applications, an issue far beyond the control of how many times I tried installing the Operating System. I had heard of a suspiciously unrealistic-sounding new feature to Windows 8. A new feature, supposedly implemented in 2012, called Secure Boot. Curious, I opened Windows Powershell and ran the boolean command `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI`. I was hoping for the familiar, bright red ""`The term 'Command-Term/' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.`"" or at least `False` or `Cmdlet not supported on this platform`. The terminal processed the command successfully, and returned a bright white, courier, `True`

^^ಠ_ಠ

^^^God.

^^^Damnit.

For those of you who don't know, Secure Boot is part of the UEFI of machines with Windows 8. Secure Boot prevents your computer from booting any Operating System besides Windows 8, or in best case scenarios deters it and makes it the most difficult pain in the ass you will ever experience. If you have a machine that came with Windows 8, you will most likely never be able to load up a new operating system the easy, normal way. For context, imagine that crazy ex girlfriend that you broke up with. Now imagine her with a knife, a lot of ropes and chains, padlocks, and a dark soundproofed basement. Now name her Windows 8, shove her in your computer, and imagine trying to break up with her for this hot, exotic girl you met named Ubuntu the easy, normal way, especially after telling her that she has to share the computer with this chick. 

Yeah. The people who yell at sheeple for supporting Micro$oft, as ridiculous as they are, may have a point.

I'm pretty sure that Secure Boot is the issue I'm having when trying to partition my harddrive. I realize that I could always back up my files, completely reformat my harddrive, and load Ubuntu from that most likely without a problem, but I don't want to completely lose Windows 8 until I'm familiar with Ubuntu and know that I want it.

So, if any of you could find something else that may be the issue from the information given, then that would be great just in case I'm trying to fix the wrong thing. I guess the question I'm trying to ask is: **Is there a way to disable Secure Boot? Secure Boot is a new UEFI feature in Windows Operating Systems that prevents/deters any operating system besides Windows from booting. I run Windows 8 on an HP Pavilion g4. Thank you to anyone who helps, attempts to help, or even just had the intention of helping.**",1hdxc0,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/1hdxc0/question_trouble_installing_new_os_on_windows_8/

1195,Reddit 101,"## What is reddit, really?  

* Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of ""sub""reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.  

* By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of [""default"" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.  

* Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the ""unsubscribe"" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of ""similar subreddits"" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further! 

---  

## Tips for your account.  

* [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!  

* [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!  

* Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.

## What is the sidebar?  

* The [""sidebar""](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to ""subscribe/unsubscribe"" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.  

    **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

* You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.

* Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.  

---

## Who are moderators? What do they do?  

* Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  

* Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!  

## Who are admins? What do they do?  

* [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.

* The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.  

---

## What is reddiquette?  

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.  

---  

## Help! What happened to my post?  

* reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*  

    * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*  
    Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.  

    * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*
    Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.

---  

## I have a great idea for a subreddit!

* Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them  

## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!

* Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins  

## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?  

* That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  

* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  


---

## What if I need help with something else?  

* Try /r/help for general help on reddit. /r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything.  

## I think I found a bug.

* Uh oh. If you are using an application or extension, most have a subreddit you can post in! (/r/RESIssues, /r/alienblue, /r/redditisfun). If you found a bug with reddit itself, post it to /r/bugs (more serious issues should be sent directly to the reddit security team: see the /r/bugs sidebar for contact information.)  


##Other Subreddits of Note

* Other good subreddits to check out for help with various topics are /r/Modhelp, /r/Modnews, /r/ChangeLog, /r/Blog, and /r/Announcements.

1200,About H1-B Programmers and Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Companies - my experience,"I have been a frequent reader of this sub, and I always found it fascinating to read stories and discussions on H1-B program or H1-B programmers here. Having been on the other side of this story, I found some of it to be truthful, some wrong, some dishonest, and most of it to be stereotypical. In most cases, the participation has always been one sided, so I thought I should share my point of view. This is not an effort to convince anyone of anything - this is about what I experienced as an H1-B migrant. Yes, I will try to make some points on what I believe to be misconceptions, but I am not writing this in defense of anything.

This may become a long post - apologies in advance if it's not your style.

----------------------

A little bit on my H1-B journey: I am from India. I hold Bachelor of Engineering (undergrad) degree - but not in Computer Science. Right after my undergrad, I was picked up by one of those 'famous' Indian giant companies to be a software engineer. I was trained for 3 months in some very basic subjects of C, Unix, Databases etc. Then we did some mock projects mocking a real system and eventually started working on a real but small project where real learnings happened. I was fortunate to work with some really bright computer engineers/programmers and learned a lot that helps me even today. Eventually, I made it to the USA on H1-B program. Since then, I have been in this country for more than 10 years, have become US citizen, have a great family and a nice job. I love technology in general and programming in particular. I travel around the country whenever I get a chance. It's been good so far.

----------------------

Here is my take on things I have read here or somewhere else on the contentious subject of H1-B:

## On The Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Company:
Companies such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS are not just supplying bodies to the Evil American Corporation. They take up small/big projects (may be maintenance or support project, or may be a bigger product/feature/website development project). They have some people on-site, but many more people offshore working on programming/development/coding/testing.
At the same time, in a lot of cases, they could provide people to work on a client site merely as another software engineer for the client. But that’s not what makes them money, and they don’t really prefer doing it.

Most of their clients are medium to large to enterprise companies. There are some technology companies too, but big retail chains, big new york banks etc are more typical clients.
They recruit freshers in big numbers. Train them for a short time in basics of programming and then are allocated to work on real projects. For a while, they perform less important/less critical tasks. But the real education do happen on these projects. They eventually become good enough to start being productive. (Those without any competence are either let go, or - if they somehow manage to wing it for a year or two - will become managers. Yes.)

These places are not easy to work at. A lot of competition. Typical rat race. To move up the ladder, you have to be a very good programmer (and a very good talker) or have a very good godfather manager to take care of you. In most cases, people don’t want to be a better programmer or learn new technologies or want to continue on technical stream. They want to become manager (project manager, product manager, bullshit manager, real manager - whatever). I think this happens because most of the employees are not naturally good at programming. They just happen to be in IT because that’s what pays.

Having said that, a really good techie can make a very successful career, if he/she is equally good at selling himself/herself. At the same time, a good programmer who isn’t good at selling himself can go through the process hell where nobody gives shit about his talents and loses creativity, passion and love for technology. Really good ones will know this early on and move out to a real technology company.

These companies have processes in place. A lot of it actually. There are a billion documents to prepare, a million of audits to go through, and a thousand standards to be certified with. While having some processes in place is a good thing, these places are nightmares for those who want to just program. They process the shit out of everybody and everything.

These companies do have some good programmers working for them. I have worked with some truly talented people. They understand tenets, nuances and principles of programming/software engineering and use it brilliantly. They are as good as a good programmer you may find in the US or anywhere. But they are not the norm. Most of the programmers are average. They follow the orders, churn out code as per requirements. They just want to get their paychecks, move up the ladder as fast as they can so they don’t have to code anymore.


## On Salaries and Doing Things Illegally:

These companies, contrary to popular belief, do not really try anything illegal.
In the past, they might have bent the rules like sending somebody onsite to do real work on business visa (a strict no-no), but those were exceptions then and almost never happen nowadays.

They do not pay that badly. Yes, they are not going to be paying top money, but their salaries are dictated by the laws where they can’t really exploit their employees. E.g. Around 10 years back, say a guy with 4-6 years of experience in software development might have been paid 70-80k salary working in, say, north-east region.

They do not take away anyone’s passport. Never. (This actually happens a lot with those small companies who basically promise H1-B to a lot of unfortunate graduates in India for a hefty commission, and almost everything they do is illegal, but this is definitely not true for big established companies like Infosys, TCS, CTS etc.)

They can’t and don’t prevent people from leaving and switching their employers. They try to retain such people, but not illegally - like taking their passports away or threatening them.

## On Going Onsite (or Nirvana!):

Once you win H1-B lottery, the company will try ASAP to place you on-site in the states. That’s because there is a limited number of people with this visa, and there is a huge demand for them to be on-site - as project coordinators, as client-site development/maintenance/support team member, or in some cases purely to add another person to client development team.
Also this is a wet dream of any Indian programmer working for these companies. The Purpose of Life. The Ultimate Goal. Nirvana. Whatever you call it.

They will board a flight, find other coworkers already settled at the destination city, arrange for a short term accommodation with them or with their help. In most cases, these companies have large number of people already onsite. So for a newcomer, it’s easy to settle in. In cases where the client is in the town of Bumblefuck and there is nobody there they know, people will still figure things out and be the torchbearer for next set of incoming people. Indians are crafty enough to figure things out.

For most people, they have two end goals for their Trip to the USA - either settle here for good, or make enough money to buy a very expensive apartment in Bangalore. So they wish for a long term project. Some people are sent only for short terms, but they too return back eventually for long term.

Few of them struggle and find difficult to adjust to new country, new culture and new people - but most of them are flexible enough to be able to continue living for long time.
These companies are reluctant to file for green-cards because it's expensive to do so, but they do it for a minority of H1-B employees. If you have a good clout or a friendly manager, are good at talking, or are critical to a project, companies most likely will do it for you, but it’s not easy.

Those who are still not married or are traveling without family share accommodations - this maximizes their savings, and they don’t mind sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with three other people. India is a country of a lot of people, and we are used to be around lot of people. Granted, some of these apartments are small and crowded, but most of these people have absolutely no problem with it.

A lof of H1-B migrants do not mix well with local people, or culture. They will form their own groups within and without the office space. If there are large number of other people from their mother company at client site, they will stick to each other, go for lunches together in big groups. If and when they become comfortable at client site, they will also start behaving with more freedom and less professionally - which means talking and laughing loudly in their groups, speaking in their mother-tongues etc. They will stick to eating Indian food most/all the time. Most of them are not adventurous enough to try new cuisine. Well, other than Dominoe's. They stick to watching Indian movies. Of course they will also watch Hollywood blockbusters, but they don’t explore anything other than mainstream movies. They have absolutely no idea about local music pubs, arts or museums.
They like big breaks for tea/coffee and spend time on silly talks. That’s because a lot of them have no family and have no life outside work.
They spend hours at office. Even after they go home, they will have calls with offshore teams that can last until midnight.
Did I mention most of them have no life outside work? They don’t.
Some people are good at programming and technology, and they will stand out among other average people. If they are adventurous enough, they will get a decent job (since H1-B allows people to switch jobs). But most of them never consider that option because they have average programming skills.

## My own experience as H1-B programmer:
My first project was for a big bank, where I started on the project at off-shore, in India, and was eventually sent onsite when I had my H1-B.

It was a charged environment where there was already a lot of anger against people like me among the programmers and other employees at the client company. I didn’t know any of that, until I started noticing odd behaviors of people. (Note: People on H1 visa at the client site are almost always treated as second class citizens - partially because they don’t try to mix well with local employees, partially because of a huge cultural divide, but mainly because they are a threat to local employment. Even when there isn't any loss of jobs with local employees, they are always suspicious. I don’t find this surprising, but it’s not a good experience for any of the two parties.)

I moved onto a different client, different team, had a much pleasant experience, was welcome to the client team, but always worked on shitty projects. I did my best in whatever work I did, impressed my colleagues and client managers and kept at it - until I got a green-card (not through my employer, but with a different route of family sponsorship).

I quit as soon as I could, found a much better job with more challenging and satisfying work, and haven’t looked back since.

I consider myself a very good programmer, have loved doing what I do and would wnat to continue doing it for as long as I can. My job pays well, I have traveled a lot, have made many friends from all parts of life, and have settled in well.

I find this country and people to be very friendly, very accommodating and fun. There are a thousand things to do outside work, and I engage in a lot of them.

I can go on, but I think this should give some idea of life of H1-B programmers and the Evil Indian Companies who send them here.

I can answer questions if people are interested. I will stick to what I know as objectively as possible, but in the end, they are just my opinions and my experience.

-----------------

*TLDR*: Big Indian Outsourcing Tech Companies are not as evil as they are made out to be. A typical H1-B programmer from India is most likely average at his/her work. Some are really good at their work. I was one of these programmers. I have done pretty well overall - have settled down here for good and love being a programmer working with cool people.

1202,Don't Buy RCN,"Your Question: I was charged 93 dollars this month, and it is only typically 64. I was wondering why the change, and also I would like to cancel my account because I have moved.
Please wait, an operator will be with you shortly.
You are now chatting with Max P. (Customer Care) - Customer Care
14:09Max P.: Hello Millicent! I am an RCN chat representative who specializes in helping residential 
14:10Max P.: Thank you! Please give me a moment to check into this.
14:12Max P.: I do see the change in price. I need a little more time to find out the reason.
14:13me: ok
14:16Max P.: It looks like there was a discount applied to your account, but has since dropped off.
14:16Max P.: What I mean to say is that it expired.
14:18me: I was informed that the 65 dollars was the most I'd being paying for the speed....Currently for 99 dollars you get 75 Mbps I was getting 50. That is a huge difference in speed, and price.
14:18me: In fact, on your website now, in years 2-3 for 50 Mbps, it is only 59.99
14:19Max P.: That is new customer pricing. After a year, as with all companies, the price does increase.
14:19me: Yes, but that is year 3! at 59.99!
14:19me: not the first year
14:19me: not the second year
14:19me: but the third
14:20me: not a new customer price
14:20me: I have had RCN for 2 years.
14:20Max P.: I would be happy to credit the account for this month by $25 to account for the change in price.
14:21me: I am also wishing to cancel my account, can I get the $25 as a refund, or only as a credit to future charges, as I won't have any future charges
14:22Max P.: To cancel your account, you will need to call Customer Care at 1-800-746-4726. They are open 24/7. Unfortunately, I am not able to cancel services through chat.
14:23me: Thats fine, but will it be refunded or just credited? Also I would like to point out that I have been a customer for 2 years, and have been paying the 3 year price. I have been a loyal customer, and have been happy with the service, however the sudden, and unpredictable change in price, led my bank account to be overdrawn. I am very displeased with this. I think that to make good on the deal, I should be credited for the whole month.
14:24me: I feel as If i have been scammed
14:26Max P.: I am sorry you feel that way. The credit will come as a refund since you do not have a current balance.
14:27me: You understand that the 3rd year price is 59.99 yes?
14:27me: Look at my account and tell me how long I have been a customer. Less than two years, actually.
14:27Max P.: Yes, I see that.
14:28me: So, my other question, I guess is why have I been paying for the 3rd year price. And also, is it possible to get the entire month refunded, considering you overdrew my account.
14:28Max P.: Approximately 22 months.
14:28Max P.: Let me see what can be done.
14:28me: Thank you]
14:34Max P.: Thank you for being patient.
14:35Max P.: After looking further into the pricing, the discount you had was a 12-month pricing which should have been explained to you when you upgraded.
14:35Max P.: Unfortunately, we cannot refund the amount that you paid.
14:35me: can I please speak to your manager.
14:36Max P.: I have just conferred with my manager on this. There's nothing more we can do. I am still willing to credit your account the $25 I mentioned earlier.
14:36me: let me discuss it with your manager
14:37Max P.: You will still need to give us a call. At that point you can speak with a manager, as well as disconnect your services.
14:38me: That's fine. Thank you for ripping me off, and I hope you appreciate me telling everyone one I know to avoid you from now on, as well as writing negative reviews of you all over the internet
14:38me: and I will give you a call, however, you should really consider letting me talk to your manager right now.
14:39Max P.: Absolutely, give me one moment to transfer the chat over to my supervisor.
Michelle W. has joined the conference.
Max P. has left the conversation.
14:40Michelle W.: Hi Millicent! How can I help you today?
14:41me: You have the chat log of what I discussed with max, yes?
14:41Michelle W.: Yes, I do have access to the chat log.
14:41me: Ok, can you tell me how long I have been a customer.
14:42Michelle W.: I have services were active since Aug 2011.
14:42me: and once you do that, can you tell me the 22 month pricing for my current plan?
14:43Michelle W.: When you currently signed up you had the 20Mbps for $49.99.
14:43me: Tell me, the current price for 50 Mb, at 22 months
14:45Michelle W.: I am not sure what the rates were at that time for the 50Mbps. It look like on 2/25/2012 you upgraded to the 50Mbps for $64.99 + taxes.
14:45me: So, you care more about new customers than me?
14:45Michelle W.: That rate was good until 4/1/2013.
14:46me: I have been a member for 22 months. the price, for 22 months, at 50 mb, is what?
14:46me: 54.99
14:46me: yes or no?
14:47Michelle W.: I have it was $59.99 + modem rental of $5.00
14:47me: I'm not interested in that. look at your plan right now. on your own website, and tell me the price
14:48Michelle W.: The current 2013 new customer pricing is $54.99 with Modem rental.
14:48me: your charging me 93
14:48me: see a difference?
14:49me: I don't care, about new customers. I have been with you 22 months
14:49Michelle W.: When you upgraded the package it was only good until 4/1/2013. After that was over the account goes to full retail.
14:49me: I was not informed of that
14:49me: So, RCN's official stand is that you are fine screwing me over?
14:50me: they told me, when I upgraded, that my price was in line with what the website says
14:50me: So you are fine screwing me over?
14:50Michelle W.: Regular retail rates to apply all discounts have ended.
14:50me: why?
14:50me: 22 months
14:50me: do you understand that
14:51Michelle W.: The rates are constantly changing.
14:51me: so you lied to me when I upgraded, and over charge me now
14:51Michelle W.: Every quarter the packages online change.
14:51me: does it cost you more to give me internet than someone who just signs on?
14:51me: no
14:51me: it does not
14:51me: so why do I have to pay more
14:51me: I should be refunded for the whole month
14:52Michelle W.: We do send a statement monthly either by email or mail that has the cost of what is being taken out of the account and for the dates of the services.
14:53Michelle W.: Did you not get your current statement?
14:53me: I'm still a 22 month customer, I should be on standard price
14:53me: don't give me excuses, I don't give a shit about what you are saying to me. As a business if you have an unhappy customer, you do what you can to fix it
14:53me: you don't make excuses
14:53me: you fix it
14:54Michelle W.: Are you looking to transfer services over to the new address?
14:54me: I don't know, after this, I don't think I want to be with you
14:54Michelle W.: I would be able to see about getting new customer pricing and having this current bill backdated?
14:54Michelle W.: *.
14:55me: How about, you get it back dated for me now. and then we will discuss on whether I keep you or not
14:56Michelle W.: May I have the address you currently moved to?
14:56me: no, look into getting it back dated for me now, then I will be willing to discuss with you further
14:56Michelle W.: I would only be able to backdate with a transfer of service.
14:56me: beyond that, I have nothing to say to you
14:56me: so, tell me
14:56me: is RCN ok with screwing me over
14:56me: don't give me a corporate line
14:56me: don't give me PC bullshit
14:57me: give me a straight answer
14:57me: is your company ok with overcharging and stealing money from me
14:57Michelle W.: I can not backdate the current statement as is. We send out notification. I do not think that we are pulling anything over on you.
14:57me: Why can you not back date it, if you could if I kept you?
14:57me: that's bullshit and you know it
14:58me: So, yes, RCN's official line, is that your fine with stealing money from me?
14:58Michelle W.: When it comes to backdating and getting the new customer package on I have to have it set up as a transfer of service to a new address. Without having the new address and placing the transfer, the system doesn't allow anything to be placed on the account.
14:59me: I am posting this entire chat and my bankstatement to Reddit, 4chan, and any other forum I can find, and making sure you lose business, if you do nothing to help me.
14:59Michelle W.: I am trying to help and get you a new package and help with the last statement.
15:00me: for 22 months, the price is 54.99. i have been paying 64.99. I am still under 24 months, and you are charging 93 dollars, you are stealing from me.
15:00me: I am not willing to get a transfer, as I am unwilling to trust you again
15:00Michelle W.: The price is not $54.99 for 22 months. The rate was only good for 12 months.
15:01me: bullshit
15:01me: check your website now
15:01Michelle W.: I am on the website.
15:01me: I was told that my rate would be in line with what the website said, when I switched over
15:01me: even then, it was never at 93 dollars
15:02me: It was 64.99 at 3 years when I signed up, and less than that for 2 years, and less for 1. When I upgraded, I was only with you for like 6 months
15:03me: Does RCN support Loyalty?
15:03Michelle W.: We did give you new customer pricing that was available at that time.
15:03me: then it should have been available for 3 years!!!
15:03me: you have a 3 year pricing assurance
15:03Michelle W.: From what is on there now and what was on there then are different, to what was offered last year.
15:04me: How does it go from 65 to 93
15:04Michelle W.: Currently, Yes we have the three year pricing assurance. When you upgraded that is not available. You were placed into a package that was available at that time.
15:04me: give me a detailed list of expenses. Even last year, if you gave me new customer price, as you assure me you have, you had a 3 year pricing assurance
15:05me: yes it was, not the same prices, but you absolutely had 3 year price assurance
15:05Michelle W.: You went to full retail as of 4/1/2013
15:05me: full retail is not a detailed list
15:05me: do you understand what I am asking of you, yes or now
15:05me: no*(
15:05Michelle W.: You were not placed in a three year pricing package.
15:05me: bullshit
15:05me: I absolutely was, you had a 3 year price plan.
15:05me: even back then
15:06Michelle W.: At this time I do not have a detailed list of expenses.
15:06Michelle W.: Would you like me to help with seeing if we can transfer your services and see if we can get the current statement backdated?
15:07me: No, because I don't trust your shitty business. I expect a credit for my entire month.
15:07me: WHy would i trust you with more service after stealing money from me?
15:07Michelle W.: I do apologize, a credit will not be placed on the account at this time.
15:07me: Do you have a boss? and can I talk to them please
15:08Michelle W.: We did sent out notification of the account charges before it was processed.
15:08me: If that's true, i never got it
15:08me: but i doubt the truth of such a statement
15:08me: Let me speak to your boss
15:08Michelle W.: They are not available at this time. They are out of the office. You can call us at 800-746-4726 and ask to speak with a Manager.
15:08me: they are out of the office at 3pm on a tuesday?
15:09Michelle W.: Correct! They are not in the office this week.
15:09me: wow, you guys have superb customer service.
15:10Michelle W.: Any additional questions I can help you with today?
15:10me: You can start with my 25 dollar credit that I was offered. That will almost cover my overdraft charge, that I received after being overcharged.
15:10me: Can I have your full name please, not just a w
15:11me: because I would like to know it, when talking to someone on the phone
15:11me: You have my last name, it's only fair
15:11Michelle W.: I will place the $25.00 Credit on the account for you that Max did offer. I can give you my employees ID number 021441. I am the only Michelle W.
15:12me: Also, I hope RCN looks forward to this conversation being posted on Reddit, Digg, 4chan, and other various internet forums
15:13Michelle W.: I have also posted the chat in your account so when you do call anyone can reference it.
15:13Michelle W.: The credit is now applied to the account. Your next statement will so a one time credit of $25.00.

1328,[Choose] Phone,"Hi Guys,

The other day I asked for your opinion on what type of tablet I should get. I ended up with the decision: iPad (and still considering if I should get something with Win 8 instead?)

Meanwhile I have been notified by my Carrier that I can cancel the buy of my HTC One X (as it has signal issues).

So my new question is what do you think, which phone I should get?

The phones considered/available (checked online, not in store):

* Nokia Lumia 920
* Samsung Galaxy S III / SIII 4G
* iPhone 5 (though I do not really like the iOS)

**EDIT: I think I'm going with the Lumia 920. It looks pretty sweet and I like the metro ui on the win phone 8 :)**

Thanks again for your help,

Best,

Selling Bytedance Inc.’s operations in several major English-speaking markets to Microsoft Corp. raises the hope that TikTok might suffer the sort of benign neglect that’s neutered other Microsoft-owned media assets, such as LinkedIn and Skype.

1332,Downgrading windows from 8 to 7 and some more questions,"So hello, 2 days ago i bought a completely new PC, with a pre-installed windows 8, and i hate it. After i installed it, had internet working perfectly, but then after a hic-up i restarted my router, and the internet connection was gone, but it still showed the wifi signal, tho my connection was ""limited""
Question 1) What caused this? Maybe it was some sort of driver reset or settings got reset? :o
I did a system restore to a previous point and my internet got fixed, then i was restarted my pc in order to install updates, but after that i kept getting error 651, which told me that raspppoe.sys driver file was broken or corrupted or w/e and i replaced it, still didnt change a thing...always a random dial-up connection kept showing up and failing to connect that way, but i am still connected to the internet through wi-fi and able to surf.
2) How to fix that raspppoe.sys file or 651 error specifically for win 8.
Massive question incoming, how do i uninstall this horrible windows 8 and install windows 7 which is way better for me. Somewhere i found a rumor that i wont be able to do that because HP computers dont support the downgrade? (Hewlett-Packard p6-2485eo) model of my pc.

I found that i would need to disable secure boot and enable CSM. 
3)Is that it? or do i have to do something else? How do i do enable CSM and disable secure boot? Ofc change first boot device to CD/dvd and wait for win 7 to install? Do i have to delete my partitions or just format them?

More. What about internet? Will windows 7 let me set up my internet connection manually while installing? Because i dont have any Ethernet or Video card drivers(which im going to install after im done with win 7)

Need as detailed answers as possible

1351,"Non-obvious learnings in launching current startup, after co-founding 2 startups that were acquired and 1 IPO","I posted on here before when we first launched, I wanted to update you guys on some of the learnings we’ve had.

I feel compelled to share this. I'm addicted to building products people want to use. Most people think that once you have a few wins under your belt, it's easy sailing for the next startup. I think that's only partly true. Here's some context and what I think of as non-obvious learnings.
I built my last venture-funded startup to $18M in revenue a year and was acquired. We then took the acquirer public (NYSE: TRMR). I'm now back building my next startup [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech). 
 
**Team-building** - This gets easier, as you know who the good people are at early stages and who you have chemistry with. However, if you work with the same people you have been successful with, the strengths of having the flow and chemistry sometimes might translate into the weakness of not being paranoid. You don’t want to be stuck on a certain wavelength of thinking and not add fresh blood into key conversations. I have seen this occasionally and it’s subtle. This way of thinking brought us success before, so it’ll work again this time. Not necessarily true. 
 
**Finding Product / Market fit** - Experience and calcified assumptions can be a bad thing. You tend to think less disruptively if you are not as wide-eyed. One of the learnings we had early on when starting the current company was to find a space with problems we were intimately familiar with as users and passionate about solving, but not a domain we knew much about in terms of how things were done. This way, we didn't feel shackled by assumptions. Our pain point for remote collaboration. We weren't as productive as we wanted to be on existing video conferencing systems. A lot of innovation was in supporting as many users as possible in a session. We thought for teams looking to get things done, there was little innovation in amplifying team's productivity. So we built [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech), a video conferencing platform with productivity tools on top. What was a bit non-obvious was that we have to reset ourselves to have a lot of humility in testing assumptions and re-building our network of contacts.
 
**Fund-raising** - This gets easier too since we are credible entrepreneurs with wins. That said, the surprising thing is sometimes we get questions around if we were too experienced and not wide-eyed enough. Raising too much money can turn into a downward spiral as you might be tempted to spend too much too quickly and lose the discipline that comes with a small budget.  
 
**Distribution Model** - This was probably the biggest learning. Our current business was very different than our last one. How we get to customers is extremely different. The times have also changed - how users buy certain types of software have also started to transition from field sales to inside sales and self-service. Getting up to speed here took time. We used to have a field sales driven organization that was expensive to build. Now, we are innovating on self-service to make cost of sales much lower. 
 
**Mindset** - This is probably the most important. Thematically, you just have to have a scrappy mindset again. You have to fight every dollar spent and get every dollar in. Question every assumption. Vet every investor and potential hire.
 
Overall, there’s a little grain of truth to the old line “the more experience you have, the less you know”, especially in a fast-changing segment. You just gotta keep your head steady and assume nothing.

What was it like in practice? Was it anything like we have today with smartphone platforms or videogame consoles? Can it be said that having one/very little dominant platforms in whatever category we're speaking of has made things better for everyone? For instance, I & likely plenty of other people personally am saddened that webOS & MeeGo are virtually done for & despite other OS like Jolla Sailfish, FirefoxOS, BB 10, Windows Phone, Ubuntu Phone, etc coming about, it looks like in the smartphone world, the common platforms have been decided to where people will jump into this world buying either iOS or Android, no matter how good something else may be.

Is it usually true that in such format/standard wars, that neither the most open nor most technologically superior standard wins out?

Does anyone else wonder about alternate paths reality could've taken where video, smartphone, & computing platforms these days could've ended up similar to videogame consoles - competition but still having a health industry as a whole, where everyone innovates & the good/best ideas become common practices?

1360,About H1-B Programmers and Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Companies - my experience,"I have been a frequent reader of this sub, and I always found it fascinating to read stories and discussions on H1-B program or H1-B programmers here. Having been on the other side of this story, I found some of it to be truthful, some wrong, some dishonest, and most of it to be stereotypical. In most cases, the participation has always been one sided, so I thought I should share my point of view. This is not an effort to convince anyone of anything - this is about what I experienced as an H1-B migrant. Yes, I will try to make some points on what I believe to be misconceptions, but I am not writing this in defense of anything.

This may become a long post - apologies in advance if it's not your style.

----------------------

A little bit on my H1-B journey: I am from India. I hold Bachelor of Engineering (undergrad) degree - but not in Computer Science. Right after my undergrad, I was picked up by one of those 'famous' Indian giant companies to be a software engineer. I was trained for 3 months in some very basic subjects of C, Unix, Databases etc. Then we did some mock projects mocking a real system and eventually started working on a real but small project where real learnings happened. I was fortunate to work with some really bright computer engineers/programmers and learned a lot that helps me even today. Eventually, I made it to the USA on H1-B program. Since then, I have been in this country for more than 10 years, have become US citizen, have a great family and a nice job. I love technology in general and programming in particular. I travel around the country whenever I get a chance. It's been good so far.

----------------------

Here is my take on things I have read here or somewhere else on the contentious subject of H1-B:

## On The Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Company:
Companies such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS are not just supplying bodies to the Evil American Corporation. They take up small/big projects (may be maintenance or support project, or may be a bigger product/feature/website development project). They have some people on-site, but many more people offshore working on programming/development/coding/testing.
At the same time, in a lot of cases, they could provide people to work on a client site merely as another software engineer for the client. But that’s not what makes them money, and they don’t really prefer doing it.

Most of their clients are medium to large to enterprise companies. There are some technology companies too, but big retail chains, big new york banks etc are more typical clients.
They recruit freshers in big numbers. Train them for a short time in basics of programming and then are allocated to work on real projects. For a while, they perform less important/less critical tasks. But the real education do happen on these projects. They eventually become good enough to start being productive. (Those without any competence are either let go, or - if they somehow manage to wing it for a year or two - will become managers. Yes.)

These places are not easy to work at. A lot of competition. Typical rat race. To move up the ladder, you have to be a very good programmer (and a very good talker) or have a very good godfather manager to take care of you. In most cases, people don’t want to be a better programmer or learn new technologies or want to continue on technical stream. They want to become manager (project manager, product manager, bullshit manager, real manager - whatever). I think this happens because most of the employees are not naturally good at programming. They just happen to be in IT because that’s what pays.

Having said that, a really good techie can make a very successful career, if he/she is equally good at selling himself/herself. At the same time, a good programmer who isn’t good at selling himself can go through the process hell where nobody gives shit about his talents and loses creativity, passion and love for technology. Really good ones will know this early on and move out to a real technology company.

These companies have processes in place. A lot of it actually. There are a billion documents to prepare, a million of audits to go through, and a thousand standards to be certified with. While having some processes in place is a good thing, these places are nightmares for those who want to just program. They process the shit out of everybody and everything.

These companies do have some good programmers working for them. I have worked with some truly talented people. They understand tenets, nuances and principles of programming/software engineering and use it brilliantly. They are as good as a good programmer you may find in the US or anywhere. But they are not the norm. Most of the programmers are average. They follow the orders, churn out code as per requirements. They just want to get their paychecks, move up the ladder as fast as they can so they don’t have to code anymore.


## On Salaries and Doing Things Illegally:

These companies, contrary to popular belief, do not really try anything illegal.
In the past, they might have bent the rules like sending somebody onsite to do real work on business visa (a strict no-no), but those were exceptions then and almost never happen nowadays.

They do not pay that badly. Yes, they are not going to be paying top money, but their salaries are dictated by the laws where they can’t really exploit their employees. E.g. Around 10 years back, say a guy with 4-6 years of experience in software development might have been paid 70-80k salary working in, say, north-east region.

They do not take away anyone’s passport. Never. (This actually happens a lot with those small companies who basically promise H1-B to a lot of unfortunate graduates in India for a hefty commission, and almost everything they do is illegal, but this is definitely not true for big established companies like Infosys, TCS, CTS etc.)

They can’t and don’t prevent people from leaving and switching their employers. They try to retain such people, but not illegally - like taking their passports away or threatening them.

## On Going Onsite (or Nirvana!):

Once you win H1-B lottery, the company will try ASAP to place you on-site in the states. That’s because there is a limited number of people with this visa, and there is a huge demand for them to be on-site - as project coordinators, as client-site development/maintenance/support team member, or in some cases purely to add another person to client development team.
Also this is a wet dream of any Indian programmer working for these companies. The Purpose of Life. The Ultimate Goal. Nirvana. Whatever you call it.

They will board a flight, find other coworkers already settled at the destination city, arrange for a short term accommodation with them or with their help. In most cases, these companies have large number of people already onsite. So for a newcomer, it’s easy to settle in. In cases where the client is in the town of Bumblefuck and there is nobody there they know, people will still figure things out and be the torchbearer for next set of incoming people. Indians are crafty enough to figure things out.

For most people, they have two end goals for their Trip to the USA - either settle here for good, or make enough money to buy a very expensive apartment in Bangalore. So they wish for a long term project. Some people are sent only for short terms, but they too return back eventually for long term.

Few of them struggle and find difficult to adjust to new country, new culture and new people - but most of them are flexible enough to be able to continue living for long time.
These companies are reluctant to file for green-cards because it's expensive to do so, but they do it for a minority of H1-B employees. If you have a good clout or a friendly manager, are good at talking, or are critical to a project, companies most likely will do it for you, but it’s not easy.

Those who are still not married or are traveling without family share accommodations - this maximizes their savings, and they don’t mind sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with three other people. India is a country of a lot of people, and we are used to be around lot of people. Granted, some of these apartments are small and crowded, but most of these people have absolutely no problem with it.

A lof of H1-B migrants do not mix well with local people, or culture. They will form their own groups within and without the office space. If there are large number of other people from their mother company at client site, they will stick to each other, go for lunches together in big groups. If and when they become comfortable at client site, they will also start behaving with more freedom and less professionally - which means talking and laughing loudly in their groups, speaking in their mother-tongues etc. They will stick to eating Indian food most/all the time. Most of them are not adventurous enough to try new cuisine. Well, other than Dominoe's. They stick to watching Indian movies. Of course they will also watch Hollywood blockbusters, but they don’t explore anything other than mainstream movies. They have absolutely no idea about local music pubs, arts or museums.
They like big breaks for tea/coffee and spend time on silly talks. That’s because a lot of them have no family and have no life outside work.
They spend hours at office. Even after they go home, they will have calls with offshore teams that can last until midnight.
Did I mention most of them have no life outside work? They don’t.
Some people are good at programming and technology, and they will stand out among other average people. If they are adventurous enough, they will get a decent job (since H1-B allows people to switch jobs). But most of them never consider that option because they have average programming skills.

## My own experience as H1-B programmer:
My first project was for a big bank, where I started on the project at off-shore, in India, and was eventually sent onsite when I had my H1-B.

It was a charged environment where there was already a lot of anger against people like me among the programmers and other employees at the client company. I didn’t know any of that, until I started noticing odd behaviors of people. (Note: People on H1 visa at the client site are almost always treated as second class citizens - partially because they don’t try to mix well with local employees, partially because of a huge cultural divide, but mainly because they are a threat to local employment. Even when there isn't any loss of jobs with local employees, they are always suspicious. I don’t find this surprising, but it’s not a good experience for any of the two parties.)

I moved onto a different client, different team, had a much pleasant experience, was welcome to the client team, but always worked on shitty projects. I did my best in whatever work I did, impressed my colleagues and client managers and kept at it - until I got a green-card (not through my employer, but with a different route of family sponsorship).

I quit as soon as I could, found a much better job with more challenging and satisfying work, and haven’t looked back since.

I consider myself a very good programmer, have loved doing what I do and would wnat to continue doing it for as long as I can. My job pays well, I have traveled a lot, have made many friends from all parts of life, and have settled in well.

I find this country and people to be very friendly, very accommodating and fun. There are a thousand things to do outside work, and I engage in a lot of them.

I can go on, but I think this should give some idea of life of H1-B programmers and the Evil Indian Companies who send them here.

I can answer questions if people are interested. I will stick to what I know as objectively as possible, but in the end, they are just my opinions and my experience.

-----------------

*TLDR*: Big Indian Outsourcing Tech Companies are not as evil as they are made out to be. A typical H1-B programmer from India is most likely average at his/her work. Some are really good at their work. I was one of these programmers. I have done pretty well overall - have settled down here for good and love being a programmer working with cool people.

1422,The Mars Society's University Rover Challenge Documentary,"Each year, student engineering teams from around the world immerse themselves in designing, building, and testing the next generation of Mars Rovers. University students from different engineering disciplines (mechanical, electrical, software) and science backgrounds, spend 12 months of the year preparing for the annual University Rover Challenge competition at the Mars Desert Research Station in Hanksville, Utah United States. In this grueling Mars-like environment, they test their student-built rover and themselves in a series of events such as traversing, remote scientific analysis, and retrieval and manipulation. Now in its 10th year, this challenging event has proved to be extremely rewarding for the students as individuals, but also benefits the entire field of space exploration by stimulating technical innovation and inspiring the next generation of talent who will take us forward.

You can check out the following documentary video which was produced by Protocase https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CWQlNNEotA , as a way to raise awareness of this entry point for space exploration, for students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) education, and to showcase the experience these university students receive, as they create technology that may one day work alongside human explorers in the field.

The video was premiered at the 19th Annual Mars Society Convention back in September. This four-day event brought together leading scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and government officials to address the significance of the latest in scientific discoveries and technological advances. Key discussions for the event included “how close are humans to stepping on Mars, and what technological advances are needed to make this happen?” Along with presentations from NASA and the Canadian Space Agency, The Mars Society’s Robert Zubrin also addressed the audience to close the convention. This setting was a perfect fit to showcase the documentary as these students involved in the video will aspire to be interns and full-time employees at most of the space organizations in attendance watching. All in all, it was a great two weeks for space as Elon Musk also announced his Mar’s colonization plans the following week.

For an audience who really appreciates advances in technology, what technology do you feel the students could be adapting that may help design a more functional Mars Rover? Any ideas will gladly be presented to the URC team and communicated to all teams for next year's event.

For more information on the University Rover Challenge event, have a look at urc.marssociety.org or check out more URC Mars Rovers videos at: http://www.protocase.com/about/sponsorship/rover-challenge.php

1499,The false sense of security with hidden SSIDs,"Hi everyone,

I'm a researcher at a university in the UK, currently researching Wifi localisation techniques. In my research I've realised that a lot of people broadcast personal information about themselves that they aren't aware of.

Hidden SSIDs are a way of concealing your network from the outside world, but alternatively they can be used to identify your personal unique MAC address. 

Hidden SSIDs don't broadcast, and instead require the device to actively seek out the access point in the area.

Personally, I use SSIDs that mean something to me, i.e. my name or something significant in my life, I believe that this is something that most people do. However, there are dangers to doing this.

As you can see from this [screenshot](http://imgur.com/zZk1JQj), your device broadcasts those hidden SSIDs when you are moving through areas. Any malicious attackers looking in the area for MAC addresses that can uniquely identify you will be able to do so, very easily.

Why is it dangerous? Associating a device MAC address with a person will allow a malicious attacker or security agencies to constantly detect where that user is if there are a number of compromised access points in an area. It will also enable an attacker to follow their victim home, and compromise their home network(s).

I urge everyone to rethink the name of their SSIDs if they're hidden, make it something that doesn't personally identify you, or even better, make your SSIDs public so that your device isn't actively looking for them.

Of course, I believe device manufacturers can do something about this. Device manufacturers such as Apple and Google could make their software only look for hidden SSIDs when it detects that your location correlates with a location previously stored when connecting to these hidden SSIDs.

1506,Exsiccate - recurrent lossless compression algorithm,"Hi,

My friend and I are working for 10+ years on compression algorithm. It is for fun but it looks like we did come to a place that progressing further without outside help is not really possible. As we do not have any good idea what or how to improve this situation I have come here.

Purpose of Exsiccate is to compress file without losing information. As it is recurrent then you can take such compressed file and compress it again. Obviously there is a lot of limitations to such algorithm. It takes plenty of time for one run as our math-fu is week.

I tried to contact universities asking if I can sponsor research/master thesis/Phd/whatever that would give us the required math for all the operations. In most cases my email had been ignored. Now I am asking you how I can find someone who would be interested in developing some math for us? Is master/Phd right way, or we should just hire someone, then how I can hire someone for such a task?

It probably is very unclear what I am saying so to give illustration of the issue we have to make adding or subbing bilion times as we are just not able to formulate clear math solution that would allow us to first group same millions of operations and handle as multiplication and addition instead of million additions.

PS. I would like to actually see any reply, even if it is just a ""no idea, keep trying"" ;)

I am interested in IT. It seems like there are a lot of jobs available for it, and a lot of people on reddit do it for a living and seem like the kind of folks I wouldn't mind being associated with. Other computer-related careers are interesting too, but at this point, I don't know the difference between a lot of them.

I have a BA in political science and an AAS in radiologic technology (x-ray). I live in the rural midwest. I would like to relocate to the southeast coast in the next couple years. I work as a medical secretary / telemetry tech watching heart monitors now.

I can work a computer, but I can't program one. I can take mine apart and put it back together and change out components if I need to. The only tech credentials I have are in radiologic technology. I can work an x-ray machine and a CT machine and the computers that run them. I have worked with HBOC and AS/400. I know HTML and CSS. That's it.

I'm open to self-teaching and using the many educational site that are available. I'm open to taking classes at the community college. There isn't a university within 100 miles of me right now, and I can't afford one right now anyway. So that's where I am now.

Do you have any specific, focused suggestions that can get me from where I am now to having recruiters hunt me down for a $40k tech job in Charleston within the next 2 years?

Thanks for any specific advice you can give. I'm looking for things like what languages are the most immediately valuable (like is learning C++ more important than learning C?)? What certifications will get me a job immediately? Things like that.

Again, I know I probably sound like an ass for coming here out of nowhere and thinking I can do the job you went to school for years to learn, and I apologize for that.

1509,Rant on INVISIBLE SELFIE CAMERAS ... and What They SHOULD BE Focusing on instead!,"**Anyone else pissed at the fact that mega corporations have been spending their time, money and human resource on this superficial tech for the past 5+ years ??? .** Jesus Christ!! All this JUST SO THAT WE CAN TAKE A SELFIE. ??  Stop telling us that *'this is advancement in mobile technology'.*  Who asked for this? Who???? You are just creating artificial Needs and Wants ! You are shoving this down our throats. **Even for a die hard selfie addict this tech will NOT change their experience.** Next year, smartphones companies will have this on their flagship, and demand a frigging premium price for it while ignoring stuffs which THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON.

Here are so areas i wish phone companies spent their time and resources on. Now dont tell me these are *'difficult and too challenging*' . Tech companies can do the unimaginable if they are motivated enough. So, the stuffs i would like them to focus on are

1. **Display tech that does not strain the eyes.** Yes, please think about our health. How about an anti glare anti UV or what not eye protection tech. Changing the color temp to warm only helps us to a limited extent. Add another layer within LCD Display which will have that digital ink thingie. When we wanna simply read stuffs, it will be like a Amazon Kindle. When we wanna watch videos and play games, we switch back to color display. We have OLED technology, how about me merge these two. Both these tech revolves around switching ON -OFF its pixels. Shouldn't be tough.
2.  ***Battery life***. I get it, thermodynamics and shit is a hindrance, but there are tested and proven successful technologies like S**olid State Lithium Ion, Gold Nano-Wire, Zinc-Air.**... and many more which i read about like 10+ years ago, in some tech magazine (yea, back when tech magazines was a thing). We all know that if companies pull these techs out of the universities and bring it to their labs and work on it, they can make these techs a reality for mass market consumption.
3. ***Use Periscope Lens for Selfie camera.*** This tech first appeared in Huawei P20, and now Oppo has adopted it. They use it for zoom function, but **how about we use it to divert the light from the front camera lens, and into the rear sensor.** They selfie camera would be just a light receiver. The real VIEWING and Processing of light will be done by the main rear camera . We can have a hardware toggle or software based toggle.
4. ***Use the rear panel of the phone as a Heat dissipater.*** This idea comes from the flat area in a computer processor, where we put thermal paste and attach a cooler. We cant have fans in phones, so just let the back panel of the phone act as something that can release the heat.  Imagine this scenario---, we have two CPUs, neither have a CPU Cooler attached. On CPU #1, we put a plastic/glass sheet on top . On CPU #2  we leave it open. Both will run hot, but CPU#1 will get hotter. This CPU#1 is what happens to our mobile phone SoC. Instead of confining it, how about we let its heat dissipation area be EXPOSED  through the rear? OK i may be wrong in the **physics** sense, but its  just my  layman idea.
5.  **BRING BEZELS BACK!**  Yeah, i said it. We need convenience and functionality. We need to be able to use our phones with the least **finger gymnastics.**  Who here enjoys using those curved displays on smartphones?? You have to be carefull how you hold the phone. WHY!!!! WHY DID WE MAKE THINGS HARDER FOR OURSELVES???If we bring bezels back, we can stop companies from wasting time on stupid  technologies like  IN-DISPLAY FINGER PRINT SCANNERS and NOTCH/PUNCH HOLE DISPLAYS and other techs which has ACTUALLY MADE OUR LIFE WORSE. Yes, you all may not see it, but our mobile phone **experience** has been degrading for the past few years. We are no longer able to do things we could do before, we need to realize that, we are brainwashed to believe that life is improved, when its not. INCONVENIENCE should never be called INNOVATION or FEATURE. We ranted on the '*innovations*' brought by Windows 7, so why cant we do the same for mobile tech??
6. **USER-REMOVABLE COMPONENTS.** I am sure you all see teardown videos of smartphones, on YT channels like JerryRigEverything. We want to do the same thing but with minimal tools and effort. The only thing stopping us from prying the components out are the adhesives. We had smartphones with removable batteries that were slimmer than the competition! Remember Galaxy S4 ? i owned that shit and i used it for 4 years because i could swap the battery, ALL ON MY OWN. Why do we still use *neanderthal technologies* like a GLUE in the 21st century?? Cant these tech companies come up with a solution that ensures components stay in place without GLUE??

I could go one and on, but i can see this RANT is already too long and ppl might get bored.

1510,Looking for spikes. How to increase the effectiveness of your dashboard,"Consider this:

A product manager asks an analyst: “Please make a dashboard where we can see Day 1, Day 3 and Day 7 retention rates in dynamics.”

“Are you sure?” the analyst asks. “These charts will be quite noisy. Just look how much the metrics alter from day to day. Maybe it’s a better idea to monitor the weekly retention rates instead. In this case, any random fluctuations will be smoothed out. ”

They called it a deal.

Now a new dot appears on the dashboard once a week. This dot has “Everything is fine, nothing has changed” written all over it. But sometimes, the storms of everyday life are hidden behind this apparent calm: days of ups and downs, victories and defeats that happen during weekdays and weekends.

But no one on the product team finds out about them because everyone is looking at weekly metrics. Consequently, they’re missing both the random and meaningful fluctuations.

# Why do we need dashboards?

One of the important questions that a dashboard serves to answer to product managers is “Is everything all right?” Based on the answer, there are two possible paths:

* If everything is fine, then the product manager can get back to her regular routine and carry on with her scheduled tasks.
* If some important metric has changed in a drastic way, then she must investigate it as soon as possible and come up with a plan of action.If you have a dashboard, then it’s good.

If you monitor this dashboard and use it as described earlier, then great.

To make it excellent, however, you need to change the key question that your dashboard answers.

# A spike

I first heard about the concept of spikes when I was at a theatre. It was a play about [David Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Yang_(entrepreneur)), an angel investor, serial entrepreneur, and founder and Chairman of the board of ABBYY.

In one of the scenes, scientists at a university research laboratory were conducting experiments. During the experiments, the scientists looked for what they called “spikes” on graphs (a steep rise or fall on a graph).

If there was no ”spike” and everything looked predictable, then it wasn’t interesting science-wise.

If there was a “spike,” it was clear that something interesting was happening. There was a chance to make a discovery, a breakthrough. In general, everyone was looking for spikes.

# Spikes and dashboards

Every day, something new happens to your products. Today, you’re going viral on mainstream media; yesterday, you changed the keywords for your app in the app store; the day before, a heavy rainfall drowned the city, or the team might have rolled out an update. Each point on your dashboard’s graphs represents the result of an experiment that the world (sometimes with your help) runs on your product.

Become a research scientist. Instead of asking the dashboard “Is everything OK?” ask “Is there a spike? Is there something I can learn from?” And at this moment, the changes that you used to interpret as mere accidents will push you to start learning new things about your product and your users.

Keep looking for “spikes.” Get to the very core of where they come from. Many of them will turn out to be happenstance and will hold nothing interesting to explore. But this doesn’t mean you should stop searching.

Some “spikes” will be caused by factors you haven’t thought of before, factors that can impact the metrics of your product. And this is exactly what you should be looking for: the levers that will help you move the product forward.

# What should we look for?

Don’t only look for positive changes in your dashboard. Make sure to search for the negative ones as well. If something has ruined the metrics, then moving in the opposite direction will most likely improve them.

Investigate the reasons behind the spikes. Dig deeper. If you find a reason, but it doesn’t fully explain what is happening, then keep looking.

Perhaps you will find out that the conversion rate and overall effectiveness of ad banners increased during a competitor’s television ad campaign. So why not raise your bid or allocate some extra budget during the competitor’s campaign?

Maybe a thought leader’s post on social media has brought you traffic of a much better quality than paid ads. Perhaps it makes sense to start working more closely with thought leaders?

Or let’s say the number of app downloads has doubled in one small country. Why so? How can we replicate this success in other countries?

Yet again, maybe an accidental change in the settings of the technology underlying in product suddenly caused the key product metrics to collapse. This might mean that by improving the quality of this technology, we can improve the metrics.

None of the situations described above are hypothetical; they are true stories from my own experience. And each one of them led us to significant breakthroughs.

# A case from personal experience

Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, I worked on a mobile app called Assistant. It was the most popular smart voice assistant developed by [API.AI](https://dialogflow.com/) (the app is no longer available after Google acquired API.AI; it’s now called Dialogflow).

One day, we launched a sale in the Assistant app. It wasn’t anything special – we had many similar sales before. After the sales day, I opened the dashboard to check the results. Everything looked normal. I was about to close the dashboard when I noticed something unusual.

Our routine during monthly sales was to send push notifications in ten different languages to our users. Usually, conversion rates for push notifications were similar across different languages. But in this specific case, I observed a significantly higher conversion rate for the Spanish notifications.

I decided to investigate the “spike” I found and postpone other plans to some other time. It didn’t take me too long to find the potential reason for the increase in the conversion rate. It turned out that when I had edited the notification, I had only copied the first part of the message in its Spanish version. The original, English version of the notification message was, “I have a surprise for you! Here is your 50% off deal!” But the Spanish version only read, “I have a surprise for you!”

My impression was that the conversion rate would be lower in a push notification that excluded the discount context. Many companies that provide push notification services regularly stated this in their reports.

However, I didn’t find any other explanation for the spike. So we decided to experiment with this idea and don’t mention the discount in the next sale for all the languages.

As a result, purchases doubled on our next sales day. In the next update, we did the same to our regular sales, and it increased our overall revenue by 8%. This was a significant improvement, considering the fact that the app’s yearly run rate was several million dollars.

Thus, a small unexpected fluctuation in the dashboard chart that resulted from a random error gave us quite a big increase in revenue.

*Note: I should say this doesn’t mean the same thing will work for your app. In the case I described, a number of product features went hand in hand to provide this missing-discount effect.*

# Skyeng case study

And here is an interesting case from Skyeng, a popular online school that teaches English:

*Free introductory lessons are part of our sales funnel. During these lessons a teacher determines the level of the student and her goals.*

*One day, we noticed that one of our teacher’s conversion rate from an introductory lesson into paying student was stably higher, and we are talking about 20%, which is a lot. For a long time, we tried to figure out what was the reason. We studied all of her lessons in detail but didn’t find any explanation.*

*Then we noticed that while all teachers had identical topics for their students’ introductory lesson, this teacher always had different tasks and topics for the first lessons she gave. It turned out that she looked for her students’ names in advance, and was trying to get to know her students’ hobbies a little better through social networks and search engines. She discovered what sort of things they liked and then selected the topics her potential client might like.*

*We set up the same business process for all our new clients, and now, when a person comes to us, we already know her interests and understand what we can offer. The conversion rate of our introductory lessons have increased from 60 to 75%.*

# Summing it up

The manager from our story at the beginning of this article instinctively understands that he needs noisy metrics and “spikes.” These noisy metrics and spikes can reveal something valuable that you won’t be able to find otherwise.

The analyst suggests monitoring the average metrics, which on the one hand reduces the influence of randomness, but also conceals a lot of useful information.

Here’s my advice: don’t be afraid of noisy metrics. Make sure to look for “spikes” on your dashboards. Study them. Find out the reasons behind them. Do not be quick to attribute the fluctuations you find to the game of chance or seasonality.

The dashboard that says “Everything is fine” should upset you, as it doesn’t carry any information to work with. Fluctuations are your chance for discoveries and breakthroughs.

1544,Free Degree of Computer Science using MIT OpenCourseware,"I want to create a study team to do the MIT Challenge. I created a curriculum of 180 credits and I'm thinking in achieve it in 1 year and somethink like two months. I can help you in all you need related to this, the schedule, books, etc. There's a slack team where we all share. (THIS IS JUST FOR KNOWLEDGE, MIT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A REAL DEGREE)

EDIT 15/04/2017 Link to the curriculum that I made: [MIT CHALLENGE CURRICULUM](http://imgur.com/QwigriC) 

What I did before starting and some tips:

  1. I planned it for a month due to several things. I'm from Venezuela and I have my own company. I live of the money that I make. So I bringed a friend to my company and make him a business partner with the condition that he has to do all the work. This was perfect since I'm doing 8 hours per day of study. 

   2. Another thing that is important and people forget it; a good CHAIR. If you're going to spend 8 hours every day, 4 hours on weekend, a  good chair is an important thing and not just a furniture.

   3. I made a lot of noise of what I was about to do with my friends and family in order to make this challenge a real thing and keep a little of pressure on me.

   4. Economic situation here in my country is ugly, so it's not common to have your own house, even if you have money. So I live with my family and they make a lot of noise, luckily for me, my house is not small and I fixed a room-garage just for studying and work.

  I studied an intensive week of pre-calculus before starting just to remember some math that I forgot

Are you suited for this?

 * People who is interested in Computer Science

 * People with time to learn Computer Science, this may not be a formal degree but you should take it like one

 * People with discipline

 * People friendly and willing to collaborate

 * People wanting to be tech-entrepeneurs

What do you need? 

 * A computer, basically any computer will work. 

 * Time for spend 6-9 hours a day depending on your effort 

 * A good chair to spend those hours 

 * Willingness!


A little thing about me: I studied Philosophy first and then Economics in college, I never finished none of them. I started my own company and that was my life three years until now. I always hated school and college, but I never hated to learn. So I started to see that I didn't need the traditional educational system to learn. That's when I heard about the MIT CHALLENGE done by Scott H Young. Inspired by him, I made my own curriculum and my own structure on how to accomplish this, I'm going to write later some rules that I made for this.

The rules that I made to give some structure (Test mode):


1. 12 hours/unit on every subject, MIT recommend 14 hours/unit. Scott H. Young did 6 hours/unit

2. If you don't understand something you may go to a prior subject in order to understand the premise.

3. It is supposed that a subject with 12 units (like most of them) should be done in 3 weeks, working on them 8 hours monday to friday and 4 hours each day of the weeknd, to a weekly total of 48 hours and a 3 weeks total of 144 hours. If something unexpected happens you can rearrange your time to compensate this in other days, but the total hours should be done in 3 weeks with just a few extraordinary exceptions. It is to be seen if this methodology will work.

4. If Rule #3 is broked, you will have 5 days more to finish the total hours, but with a new total of 14 hours per unit to a total of 168 hours in a 12 unit subject

5. You should have at least 180 units when you're done (This is what MIT consider a Major). This could be consider that the Major is complete (If there's no a thesis or final project)

6. (It is to be seen if it is possible to have a few days free between the subjects)

7. The general way to test your knowledge will be through the final exam if this is possible. If you fail in this test you will have two days to study for a similar test gain, and this way so on if the resources allowed it. It is to be seen what would happen if the resources are not available.




   Two days ago I started with my first subject, Introduction To Computer Science and Programming in Python. I'm going to test if it's possible to finish this first subject within the time that should be done and if I can keep with the hours per day. I'm starting to see that the feedback when you're doing programming problems would be nice with another students.
Note: I want to add that my native language is NOT english, so there are things that are a little harder for me to understand while studying than to a native english speaker.

Note 2: I want to clarify that many of the subjects are electives that you can choose.

EDIT 16/04/2017: A Slack Team was created for people who wants to do the challenge. Everyone who joins to the slack team are encourage to look first the two posts, ""Team Community Rules"" and ""General things about this team and the Challenge"" in the channel #general_rules, then you can proceed to start in the #how_to_start channel

EDIT: I noticed that some people have taken this post bad, saying it's impossible, etc. By no means I'm trying to diminish the value of people getting degrees at colleges, if it sounds like that I apologize. This is a post solely to create a team that really believes that this can be done. The benefits of self educations are many as the benefits of traditional education are many too, it depends on what you are looking for and your context. Not everyones lives in developed countries nor everyone has the money to afford a good education. The 3 weeks estimated time is just that an estimated, the evaluations are there for something, to test your knowledge. If a subject doesn't have the evaluations I encourage you to look for other options, like asking teachers to help you with that. And if it takes you more than 144 hours or 168 hours is OK, if MIT would have said that you need 20 hours per unit I would have place an estimatted effort of 240 hours for a 12 unit course instead of 168 . But you need to have a goal and a standard time in order to keep you motivated. A degree on MIT has 360 credits, in this challenge we are just studying for the major in CS 180 credits + Calculus and two Physics. Also you're free to learn different subjects at the same time, I just prefer to study one at a time.",65nr7p,168,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/65nr7p/free_degree_of_computer_science_using_mit/

1551,Making campers 'smart',"Hello everyone,

I'm doing a development project with a group for our education and the general idea is to make campers 'smart'. We have to make a concept with a voice controlled application to make the camper life easier. So we have a question. What are the things you wish you could improve in your camper, more specifically, what would you want to know from your camper? (How full is the toilet for example)

Or what are things you think could be improved about camping with a camper in general? For example when you're driving and it giving you info about nearby facilities/events or things like that.

&#x200B;

So, \*anything\* that could be improved in the complete camper experience. Thanks in advance.",anct6g,1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/anct6g/making_campers_smart/
1552,"Want a better understanding for PCB, where to start?","Little bit about myself: 

Years of experience in repairing mobile handhelds and tabs of all kind of brands.

A year of experience in laptop/macbook and imac.

All repairs were level 2 (module swaps)

No experience in soldering (yet)

No technical education background, just allot of interest and practical experience.

I can troubleshoot all kinds of problems, even main pcb but i swap those instead of fixing the component on the pcb.
This is the main reason that i want to broaden my experience, i want to be able to solder and understand the working of pcb and components.

Where should i start? 
I think my main focus should be about knowing what does what and why does something not work correctly/anymore. Right?

Any tips on read this book or check this or look up that, are very welcome!

1554,The Mars Society's University Rover Challenge Documentary,"Each year, student engineering teams from around the world immerse themselves in designing, building, and testing the next generation of Mars Rovers. University students from different engineering disciplines (mechanical, electrical, software) and science backgrounds, spend 12 months of the year preparing for the annual University Rover Challenge competition at the Mars Desert Research Station in Hanksville, Utah United States. In this grueling Mars-like environment, they test their student-built rover and themselves in a series of events such as traversing, remote scientific analysis, and retrieval and manipulation. Now in its 10th year, this challenging event has proved to be extremely rewarding for the students as individuals, but also benefits the entire field of space exploration by stimulating technical innovation and inspiring the next generation of talent who will take us forward.

You can check out the following documentary video which was produced by Protocase https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CWQlNNEotA , as a way to raise awareness of this entry point for space exploration, for students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics) education, and to showcase the experience these university students receive, as they create technology that may one day work alongside human explorers in the field.

The video was premiered at the 19th Annual Mars Society Convention back in September. This four-day event brought together leading scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and government officials to address the significance of the latest in scientific discoveries and technological advances. Key discussions for the event included “how close are humans to stepping on Mars, and what technological advances are needed to make this happen?” Along with presentations from NASA and the Canadian Space Agency, The Mars Society’s Robert Zubrin also addressed the audience to close the convention. This setting was a perfect fit to showcase the documentary as these students involved in the video will aspire to be interns and full-time employees at most of the space organizations in attendance watching. All in all, it was a great two weeks for space as Elon Musk also announced his Mar’s colonization plans the following week.

For an audience who really appreciates advances in technology, what technology do you feel the students could be adapting that may help design a more functional Mars Rover? Any ideas will gladly be presented to the URC team and communicated to all teams for next year's event.

For more information on the University Rover Challenge event, have a look at urc.marssociety.org or check out more URC Mars Rovers videos at: http://www.protocase.com/about/sponsorship/rover-challenge.php

1555,USA-China new digital Cold War?,". Huawei, among other items, makes a key product called radio access networks, (or RANs) the part of a telecommunications system that connects phones to telco networks through radio connections including base stations, antennas, chips and controllers. Besides Huawei, the RAN business, (which is about $76 billion in annual sales,) is dominated by Samsung (Korean), Ericsson (Swedish), Nokia (Finnish) and ZTE (also Chinese and also at loggerheads with the U.S. government.)

The Trump administration at first began telling allies in Europe that buying Huawei technology posed a national security risk, though with no hard evidence. That gained little traction. “The message was ‘trust us,’ but that is not a strong suit from this administration,” says an industry source. But what if the argument was framed in terms of economics, this source continued. If Huawei and ZTE gain more and more market share then the non-Chinese suppliers, which like all companies in the sectors need to spend billions of dollars of capital .
Trump’s early approach was to bully and threaten U.S. allies like Germany and the UK to abandon Huawei.   It didn’t quite work. And when the Trump administration has blocked the export of U.S. tech to China, the Chinese have responded maybe not the way Trump anticipated. “Rather than confront any U.S. restrictions, what they’ve basically done is make stronger efforts to try to reduce reliance on imported technologies, particularly U.S. ones. That seems to be part of the broader multi-year strategy that they’re implementing,” says Bruce Kasman, chief economist and managing director of global research at JPMorgan Chase.
And the Trump administration has moved to ban TikTok, which now has 80 million-plus monthly active users in the U.S. A key bone of contention here: Money, money, money. that,      this is a rivalry which will define societies; education, culture, the military,     and in the end personal freedom and responsibility.",juejmd,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/juejmd/usachina_new_digital_cold_war/
1556,Technology created to promote a positive social impact; a few examples.,"I have been trying to think of a few different examples of smart phone apps, websites, coding related technologies that have been created solely for the purpose of promoting a positive social impact. I'm aware that many technologies CAN be used for this purpose, but I'm interested in gathering some examples of the ones that were intentionally created BECAUSE of this motivation. 

For example, YouTube is a fantastic resource for education, but it wasn't built for this reason. [The Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) on the other hand, was. After the videos gained popularity, the social impact became the reason for its existence. 

[Buycott](http://www.buycott.com/) is another example of this. It is a politically neutral piece of technology, yet it was created to help bring transparency to consumerism - creating a positive social impact.

[IHME](http://www.healthmetricsandevaluation.org/) is another. 

[Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) is the only other one I can think of.  

I suppose if we considered a larger variety of technology, [SolarCity](http://www.solarcity.com/) and [Tesla](http://www.teslamotors.com/) could probably be considered, but I'm primarily interested in tech built chiefly from code.

1559,Zero to tech job? [serious],"This is going to sound horrible and probably insulting, but please take it seriously. 

I am interested in IT. It seems like there are a lot of jobs available for it, and a lot of people on reddit do it for a living and seem like the kind of folks I wouldn't mind being associated with. Other computer-related careers are interesting too, but at this point, I don't know the difference between a lot of them.

I have a BA in political science and an AAS in radiologic technology (x-ray). I live in the rural midwest. I would like to relocate to the southeast coast in the next couple years. I work as a medical secretary / telemetry tech watching heart monitors now.

I can work a computer, but I can't program one. I can take mine apart and put it back together and change out components if I need to. The only tech credentials I have are in radiologic technology. I can work an x-ray machine and a CT machine and the computers that run them. I have worked with HBOC and AS/400. I know HTML and CSS. That's it.

I'm open to self-teaching and using the many educational site that are available. I'm open to taking classes at the community college. There isn't a university within 100 miles of me right now, and I can't afford one right now anyway. So that's where I am now.

Do you have any specific, focused suggestions that can get me from where I am now to having recruiters hunt me down for a $40k tech job in Charleston within the next 2 years?

Thanks for any specific advice you can give. I'm looking for things like what languages are the most immediately valuable (like is learning C++ more important than learning C?)? What certifications will get me a job immediately? Things like that.

Again, I know I probably sound like an ass for coming here out of nowhere and thinking I can do the job you went to school for years to learn, and I apologize for that.

1566,About H1-B Programmers and Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Companies - my experience,"I have been a frequent reader of this sub, and I always found it fascinating to read stories and discussions on H1-B program or H1-B programmers here. Having been on the other side of this story, I found some of it to be truthful, some wrong, some dishonest, and most of it to be stereotypical. In most cases, the participation has always been one sided, so I thought I should share my point of view. This is not an effort to convince anyone of anything - this is about what I experienced as an H1-B migrant. Yes, I will try to make some points on what I believe to be misconceptions, but I am not writing this in defense of anything.

This may become a long post - apologies in advance if it's not your style.

----------------------

A little bit on my H1-B journey: I am from India. I hold Bachelor of Engineering (undergrad) degree - but not in Computer Science. Right after my undergrad, I was picked up by one of those 'famous' Indian giant companies to be a software engineer. I was trained for 3 months in some very basic subjects of C, Unix, Databases etc. Then we did some mock projects mocking a real system and eventually started working on a real but small project where real learnings happened. I was fortunate to work with some really bright computer engineers/programmers and learned a lot that helps me even today. Eventually, I made it to the USA on H1-B program. Since then, I have been in this country for more than 10 years, have become US citizen, have a great family and a nice job. I love technology in general and programming in particular. I travel around the country whenever I get a chance. It's been good so far.

----------------------

Here is my take on things I have read here or somewhere else on the contentious subject of H1-B:

## On The Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Company:
Companies such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS are not just supplying bodies to the Evil American Corporation. They take up small/big projects (may be maintenance or support project, or may be a bigger product/feature/website development project). They have some people on-site, but many more people offshore working on programming/development/coding/testing.
At the same time, in a lot of cases, they could provide people to work on a client site merely as another software engineer for the client. But that’s not what makes them money, and they don’t really prefer doing it.

Most of their clients are medium to large to enterprise companies. There are some technology companies too, but big retail chains, big new york banks etc are more typical clients.
They recruit freshers in big numbers. Train them for a short time in basics of programming and then are allocated to work on real projects. For a while, they perform less important/less critical tasks. But the real education do happen on these projects. They eventually become good enough to start being productive. (Those without any competence are either let go, or - if they somehow manage to wing it for a year or two - will become managers. Yes.)

These places are not easy to work at. A lot of competition. Typical rat race. To move up the ladder, you have to be a very good programmer (and a very good talker) or have a very good godfather manager to take care of you. In most cases, people don’t want to be a better programmer or learn new technologies or want to continue on technical stream. They want to become manager (project manager, product manager, bullshit manager, real manager - whatever). I think this happens because most of the employees are not naturally good at programming. They just happen to be in IT because that’s what pays.

Having said that, a really good techie can make a very successful career, if he/she is equally good at selling himself/herself. At the same time, a good programmer who isn’t good at selling himself can go through the process hell where nobody gives shit about his talents and loses creativity, passion and love for technology. Really good ones will know this early on and move out to a real technology company.

These companies have processes in place. A lot of it actually. There are a billion documents to prepare, a million of audits to go through, and a thousand standards to be certified with. While having some processes in place is a good thing, these places are nightmares for those who want to just program. They process the shit out of everybody and everything.

These companies do have some good programmers working for them. I have worked with some truly talented people. They understand tenets, nuances and principles of programming/software engineering and use it brilliantly. They are as good as a good programmer you may find in the US or anywhere. But they are not the norm. Most of the programmers are average. They follow the orders, churn out code as per requirements. They just want to get their paychecks, move up the ladder as fast as they can so they don’t have to code anymore.


## On Salaries and Doing Things Illegally:

These companies, contrary to popular belief, do not really try anything illegal.
In the past, they might have bent the rules like sending somebody onsite to do real work on business visa (a strict no-no), but those were exceptions then and almost never happen nowadays.

They do not pay that badly. Yes, they are not going to be paying top money, but their salaries are dictated by the laws where they can’t really exploit their employees. E.g. Around 10 years back, say a guy with 4-6 years of experience in software development might have been paid 70-80k salary working in, say, north-east region.

They do not take away anyone’s passport. Never. (This actually happens a lot with those small companies who basically promise H1-B to a lot of unfortunate graduates in India for a hefty commission, and almost everything they do is illegal, but this is definitely not true for big established companies like Infosys, TCS, CTS etc.)

They can’t and don’t prevent people from leaving and switching their employers. They try to retain such people, but not illegally - like taking their passports away or threatening them.

## On Going Onsite (or Nirvana!):

Once you win H1-B lottery, the company will try ASAP to place you on-site in the states. That’s because there is a limited number of people with this visa, and there is a huge demand for them to be on-site - as project coordinators, as client-site development/maintenance/support team member, or in some cases purely to add another person to client development team.
Also this is a wet dream of any Indian programmer working for these companies. The Purpose of Life. The Ultimate Goal. Nirvana. Whatever you call it.

They will board a flight, find other coworkers already settled at the destination city, arrange for a short term accommodation with them or with their help. In most cases, these companies have large number of people already onsite. So for a newcomer, it’s easy to settle in. In cases where the client is in the town of Bumblefuck and there is nobody there they know, people will still figure things out and be the torchbearer for next set of incoming people. Indians are crafty enough to figure things out.

For most people, they have two end goals for their Trip to the USA - either settle here for good, or make enough money to buy a very expensive apartment in Bangalore. So they wish for a long term project. Some people are sent only for short terms, but they too return back eventually for long term.

Few of them struggle and find difficult to adjust to new country, new culture and new people - but most of them are flexible enough to be able to continue living for long time.
These companies are reluctant to file for green-cards because it's expensive to do so, but they do it for a minority of H1-B employees. If you have a good clout or a friendly manager, are good at talking, or are critical to a project, companies most likely will do it for you, but it’s not easy.

Those who are still not married or are traveling without family share accommodations - this maximizes their savings, and they don’t mind sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with three other people. India is a country of a lot of people, and we are used to be around lot of people. Granted, some of these apartments are small and crowded, but most of these people have absolutely no problem with it.

A lof of H1-B migrants do not mix well with local people, or culture. They will form their own groups within and without the office space. If there are large number of other people from their mother company at client site, they will stick to each other, go for lunches together in big groups. If and when they become comfortable at client site, they will also start behaving with more freedom and less professionally - which means talking and laughing loudly in their groups, speaking in their mother-tongues etc. They will stick to eating Indian food most/all the time. Most of them are not adventurous enough to try new cuisine. Well, other than Dominoe's. They stick to watching Indian movies. Of course they will also watch Hollywood blockbusters, but they don’t explore anything other than mainstream movies. They have absolutely no idea about local music pubs, arts or museums.
They like big breaks for tea/coffee and spend time on silly talks. That’s because a lot of them have no family and have no life outside work.
They spend hours at office. Even after they go home, they will have calls with offshore teams that can last until midnight.
Did I mention most of them have no life outside work? They don’t.
Some people are good at programming and technology, and they will stand out among other average people. If they are adventurous enough, they will get a decent job (since H1-B allows people to switch jobs). But most of them never consider that option because they have average programming skills.

## My own experience as H1-B programmer:
My first project was for a big bank, where I started on the project at off-shore, in India, and was eventually sent onsite when I had my H1-B.

It was a charged environment where there was already a lot of anger against people like me among the programmers and other employees at the client company. I didn’t know any of that, until I started noticing odd behaviors of people. (Note: People on H1 visa at the client site are almost always treated as second class citizens - partially because they don’t try to mix well with local employees, partially because of a huge cultural divide, but mainly because they are a threat to local employment. Even when there isn't any loss of jobs with local employees, they are always suspicious. I don’t find this surprising, but it’s not a good experience for any of the two parties.)

I moved onto a different client, different team, had a much pleasant experience, was welcome to the client team, but always worked on shitty projects. I did my best in whatever work I did, impressed my colleagues and client managers and kept at it - until I got a green-card (not through my employer, but with a different route of family sponsorship).

I quit as soon as I could, found a much better job with more challenging and satisfying work, and haven’t looked back since.

I consider myself a very good programmer, have loved doing what I do and would wnat to continue doing it for as long as I can. My job pays well, I have traveled a lot, have made many friends from all parts of life, and have settled in well.

I find this country and people to be very friendly, very accommodating and fun. There are a thousand things to do outside work, and I engage in a lot of them.

I can go on, but I think this should give some idea of life of H1-B programmers and the Evil Indian Companies who send them here.

I can answer questions if people are interested. I will stick to what I know as objectively as possible, but in the end, they are just my opinions and my experience.

-----------------

*TLDR*: Big Indian Outsourcing Tech Companies are not as evil as they are made out to be. A typical H1-B programmer from India is most likely average at his/her work.

2. Twitter Acquired Lucky Sort:

3. IN-FLIGHT DIGITAL MAGAZINES:
All bigger names in aviation have started to serve Digital Magazines and Newspapers to improve their In-Flight Services .When Newsweek, in January 2013, decided to go completely digital, I tried to evangelized the scope of usage of Digital Magazines and posted a Tweet mentioning the areas like Healthcare, Aviation etc. As pointed out by Airlinetrends.com,this has already started trending in aviation sector.In an effort to offer passengers a much wider range of news and reading option, instead the bunch of newspapers and magazines currently available airlines such as Air France, AirBerlin, Virgin Australia and ANA have started to provide passengers with access to digital Newspapers and Magazines before their flight leaves.

1715,Announcement: New rules and the future focus of /r/tech,"Hello /r/tech,

Before I announce our new rule, I would like to take a moment to talk to explain the issue before us: politics, technology and how politics will always dominate any subreddit that it has anything to do with.

---

As many of you know, reddit ranking has to do with votes. People who like a story or post vote it up and more people see it. If they vote it down, less people will  see it. It really is an elegant system in a lot of ways. What quite a number of people don't realize, however, is that time plays a huge factor into the algorithm as well. Posts that are upvoted more quickly rise exponentially faster than posts that take more time to be upvoted. I'm sure you are all aware of the dangers of memes, images and videos in any serious subreddit. Since they are so much more quickly taken in than a news article, they are voted on faster and they will easily outpace that news article and take over the subreddit if they are not culled by the moderation team.

---

I would propose to you that the same is true for political content. [This was the front page of /r/technology yesterday](http://i.imgur.com/D59S85G.png). /r/tech's wasn't much better. The reason these political posts reach the front page so quickly is that the outrage that they trigger in the reader makes them click that upvote button so much faster than they would if they had to read a thoughtful article on the subject. Many people will vote *without even reading the article.* That's why the front page page of both subreddits was entirely full of politics, and without some sort of change the subreddit will continue to be full of political posts until the end of time. It is simple impossible for a cool, quirky article about new piece of technology to compete with the latest news about that company that you love or revile or the latest bit of outrageous politics. The votes don't happen fast enough to compete.

---

We have mulled over a new focus for the subreddit for some time. After considering your input and doing some brainstorming of our own, we decided that we want this subreddit to be about *innovation* and *changes* in technology and not just straight technology related news and politics. We want to see some cool stuff that we've never seen before and not dwell in the minutia of the everyday goings on at Company X or Y. We're not really interested in the outrage of the minute in the ongoing debate over net neutrality. It is important, we realize, but endless political discussion gets tiring and depressing. We want somewhere fun and interesting with cool gadgets and things that are going to improve our lives and not the depressing, political outrage of the minute.

---

To that end, here is our new rule:

* Posts should be about innovations in technology. Submissions that are not related to innovations belong in /r/technews. If a post is political, it should go in /r/politicaltech or /r/politics.

---

Our vision is a subreddit where people can post the gadgets, neat software and technological innovations of today in a optimistic and forward looking way and without get bogged down in the outrage of the minute, politics and drama. We want a place where redditors can come and geek out about shiny things and space rockets, without being burdened by the Supreme Court politics and the latest CEO of Microsoft or Apple.

---

This should not be interpreted as a blanket ban on all things political, but the politics in the subreddit should be limited to significant changes in tech law and current events. When news breaks and we notice an uptick in threads about a political subject, we will make a mega thread for everything to be discussed in a central location instead of allowing it to dominate the entire subreddit.

---



So with our largest new rule out of the way, here are the new rules (with changes in bold):


### Allowed submissions
> 
> * High quality news articles about technology.
> * Informative and thought provoking self-posts
> * **Posts should be about innovations in technology. Posts not directly related to technological advances and political posts belong in /r/technews, /r/politicaltech, and /r/politics.**

### Disallowed submissions
>
> * Memes and image macros
> * Links to images and videos
> * Blogspam
> * Editorialized/sensationalized titles
> * Requests for tech support or PC building advice
> * Petitions and surveys.
> * Crowdfunding (i.e. kickstarter and similar websites)
> * **Duplicates of already highly upvoted stories**
> * **Links to other subreddits**

### Disallowed comments
> 
> * **Racism and bigotry**
> * **Attacks on other users**
> * **Unmarked NSFW links**

---

1765,Google RCS chatbot,"Full context at bottom if needed.

I was asked to create a very basic Google RCS chatbot. I started doing it in Google's ""Dialogflow"" when things started to get confusing:

1. I noticed that on top of ""Dialogflow"", Google has a seperate [platform for RCS](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging) and now I'm not sure which one I should be using. I can't seem to use the new platform as [this page says](https://jibe.google.com/early-access/) I have to contact their partnet to request early access. If I do a regular google sign-in on the first page, it just redirects me back to the same page.
2. In Dialogflow, testing works fine if the bot responds with regular text. If it's an RCS then it doesn't work and I'm not sure where I can test that?


&nbsp;



&nbsp;

&nbsp;


If it helps, this is the **full context**:

I'm a sysadmin in a tiny company that deals with phone numbers databases. Since RCS seems to become a thing, there was some talk at the top of ""getting in the game"". A very generous telecom company has agreed to involve us in their demo platform. I was asked to create a super dummy RCS chatbot to get things going - enough to fill the requirements ([this excel sheet](https://i.imgur.com/ZqreI6Q.png)). If everything goes to plan then we'll probably hire someone more experienced to build what we need.

This is a little overwhelming to me because there is just no info online. At first I thought that these chatbots are built with ""Dialogflow"" but now I see there's a early access platform which I can't seem to understand how to get or if that's what I need. To get things more confusing I can't seem to request the early access going. I'm not even sure how I can test the chatbot I created with Dialogflow because their on-site testing only works for text.",i7qqu2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/i7qqu2/google_rcs_chatbot/

I mean, yea sure you can find reviews for an individual printer if you search for *that* specific one, but if you search for ""best printer"" or something like that, all you get is these spam channels with their affiliate links telling you the printers are great. And if you're lucky you'll also get it in a robot voice.

This is in contrast to if you search for, like ""best gpu 2019"" or best camera, or whatever. Yea, you'll get some of these spam channels, but you'll get some legit stuff as well from Linus Tech Tips, or whoever.

I dare you, search for ""best printer 2019"" and try to find a decent result that isn't full of stock footage. Sometimes they're so bad that you can go to Amazon and read along with them.

Then, we used Lubi to get rid of Window's 7.  Then, instead of enlarging the OS, she changed the partition of Ubuntu entirely, rendering the computer entirely unbootable.  We tried everything in the 'USB booting' department, but we can't seem to get it to boot over USB for whatever bloody reason.

A home grown Chinese mobile OS addresses none of those issues.

Could Huawei try to relicate Google's services and build their own Youtube, Search and Maps? They sure can try, but that ain't easy or cheap. Just ask Microsoft or Baidu how that initiative is working out for them.  And on top of that, they now need to design their own semi-conductors. From scratch.

1792,Idea for better Internet Protocol/Data Transmission/DNS/etc.,"First of all, this is completely an idea. I have not programmed ANY of this, though I do hope to make it an actuality!

Over the past few weeks, I've been thinking about all of the inefficiencies of the Internet protocol, both IPv4 and IPv6. One of my main problems with the current system is that whenever you connect to a different network, there are (at least) 3 things you need to know: The router address, your address, and the external address of the network. All three of these things change as you connect to different networks.

Another problem is the way to connect to other devices, mainly external devices (i.e. devices outside of your network/intranet). If you don't pay the extravagant fees for a static IP, your external IP can change basically at the mercy of your ISP (more of a problem with IPv4 than IPv6 - however, I personally find it harder to remember IPv6 addresses than IPv4 addresses, even if neither change, which I'm sure they will).

I am here to propose a new idea for the way the Internet works. (OK, maybe that's a little boasty.) What I am thinking of is quite detailed, and is by no means to be considered perfect or even complete. As I mentioned before, I have been planning this for weeks (maybe even months), and I think it is in a form that is not necessarily usable, but at least enough information and thought that someone (me or otherwise) could do something with. So here it goes.

**I propose a decentralized, free and open-source, permanent system for keeping track of and identifying computers and other devices in a large-scale environment.**

What this means is that when you first connect to the system, you are given a *unique* address. You would keep that address forever. No matter what network you connect to, however many devices there are, you will always have the same address. The address would be any combination of numbers and letters (1234567890, abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz, ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ), and colons (:). The address would look something like this:  
`00:Ab:cD:ef:GH:12:34:56:Ij:78:kL:90`  
The order of numbers and letters doesn't matter (except the beginning `00`, but we'll get to that later). Another example is this:  
`00:hD:8J:F9:Hh:D5:33:Io:0P:wW:7y:8Y`  
It really doesn't matter. The default option is to generate a random address (with two numbers at the beginning - again, more on this later); however, there is also an option for the user to generate their own address, maybe something like:  
`    00:Th:eM:ac:Mi:ni:09:\*\*:\*\*:\*\*:\*\*:\*\*`  
Where a star is randomly generated by the computer. The only system I've ever seen using an address generation system like this one is Bitcoin - however, it takes a *long* time to generate a long so-called vanity address. More on the generation later.

Now that the problem of remembering tons of different addresses is gone, I move on to the next challenge: Connecting to devices outside of your local network. I came up with the following: When a device wants to make itself public, it will (usually) communicate with the router. When the router first enables this new system, it will automatically generate an address the same way as above (again with the option of generating a custom address). Now that the two devices both have addresses, they can communicate (again, more on this later). Now, you only need to remember two addresses (plus one for every device you own - however, you can use different naming schemes. If that still seems like a large number, think of how many you would have to remember if you connected all of those devices to many networks, each giving you different IP addresses).

So we've covered remembering addresses, as well as generating those addresses in a way that is memorable but also efficient. Next I would like to address addresses. (This is where decentralization comes in)

When you set up any device with this new system the first time, you will be asked if you want to run a 'full node.' A box will pop-up, informing you the amount of space you will need on your hard drive, as well as the approximate amount of bandwidth, and the speed of your internet connection, that is necessary. After checking to make sure that you meet the requirements, you will connect to the 'main node' of the system (most likely some server rented by me). The main node would contain only two things (accessible to the public): A list of all nodes and their addresses, and a list of all addresses in use. Those two files (probably in the CSV format, named `nodes.csv` and `addresses.csv`, maybe later changed to and SQL database) would be then downloaded to the new node, and will synchronize any new information with other nodes. You also need to enter your desired address (there would be a Random buttone), and optionally information such as a username, full name, real address, city/town, province/state/territory, and email address. You will then click verify, and the data will be sent to one of the nodes. The node will then search for two things: the address and the username. If neither exist, a new entry would be added to `addresses.csv`, and if you chose to be a node, `nodes.csv`. If the address already existed, the software will automatically try to find one similar to the one you picked and give you a list of alternatives. An example `addresses.csv` entry could look like:

| Address                             | Username     | Full Name | Location | UNIX Timestamp |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 00:Th:eM:ac:Mi:ni:09:Hq:5K:4g:93:wK | TheMacMini09 | Nope      | No way   | 1398552391     |

An example `nodes.csv` entry could look like:

Address | Username
:--|:--
00:Th:eM:ac:Mi:ni:09:Hq:5K:4g:93:wK | TheMacMini09

(Also, there is a total of 1.0408^43 possible addresses (62 different characters, 12 sets of two characters, 62^24 = ~1.0408^43)

I think the only I haven't yet answered is the beginning two digits of every address (00 in my examples). The first addresses to be generated will start with 00. Only after every address spot is filled up in section 00 (approximately 2.708^39 addresses) will section 01 start. The order will continue through the order as follows:

`00 01 02 ... 09 0A 0B 0C ... 0Z 0a 0b 0c ... 10 11 12 ... 19 1A 1B ... zy zz`

Therefore anyone can see approximately when an address has been created (in a range of dates - say, for instance, that tomorrow, April 27th, 2014, this system is implemented, and section 01 starts on July 7th, 2020, any address and therefore device registered in section 00 would have registered within the first 6 years of the system starting. However, if you decide to be a full node, you could also get the date information from the CSV files).

If there's anything you want clarified, or if you have any suggestions, please let me know! I want this to be actualized!

1794,"Hackers On Planet Earth 2020 Includes A Cyberpunk Media Hackathon, ""The Cyberpunk Now Film Festival""","Hi!

I’m leading the team organizing [The Cyberpunk Now Film Festival](https://cyberpunkfestival.com/) as part of [Hackers On Planet Earth 2020](https://hope.net/).

When I heard HOPE was going virtual for coronareasons, I wanted to help make something interesting that people could do from home.

This is a **live** film festival, where **participants must make their films during the event**.

We only have a few days until the event starts, and I'm trying to get the word out. More participants is more fun.

https://cyberpunkfestival.com/

On **July 25th** we will publish top-secret ""required challenge elements"" that have to be included in the projects (meant to establish a level playing field), and then participants will have 5 days to make a film.

The thinking is that we're very much living in a world predicted by the cyberpunk literature of the 80s and 90s, and so much of what was science fiction is now routine or the chaotic backdrop of our daily life. So, what better time to help people express themselves through this sort of channel?

Please help us get the word out about the event, and absolutely please participate. Even if you don't participate, definitely tune in on August 2nd for a screening of the winners in the HOPE livestream (not sure what time yet).

Our very colorful promo graphic can be found here: https://i.imgur.com/cHnjvN2.jpg

We're not trying to make a huge profit from submission fees. The submission fee is a speed bump to prevent low quality submission spamming. This is more of a volunteer-run thing, just fun for the community. You get a discount if you pre-register, and submissions are free if you’re also participating in HOPE.

Comments? Questions?

**Something keeps coming up that I think is interesting: Is cyberpunk dystopian?** Wikipedia says yes, but some of the famous authors say no. I put a note about this in the FAQ on the festival site, but in summary, cyberpunk was about a future where the world didn't end in a nuclear holocaust, and it is a genre which arose in the 80s, when that was a likely outcome, so many say it isn't dystopian at all, that it is rather a hopeful genre.

1796,With great power comes great responsibility – but will tech companies accept it?,"In *The Amazing Spider-*Man, a young Peter Parker is coming to grips with his newly-acquired powers. Spider-Man in nature but not in name, he suddenly finds himself with increased reflexes, strength and extremely sticky hands. 

Unfortunately, the subway isn’t the controlled environment for Parker to awaken as a sudden superhuman. His hands stick to a woman’s shoulders and he’s unable to move them. His powers are doing exactly what they were designed to do, with creepy, unsettling effects.

Spider-Man’s powers aren’t amazing yet; they’re poorly understood, disturbing and dangerous. As other commuters move to the woman’s defence, shoving Parker away from the woman, his sticky hands inadvertently rip the woman’s top clean off. Now his powers are invading people’s privacy.

A fully-fledged assault follows, but Parker’s Spider-Man reflexes kick in. He beats his assailants off, sending them careening into subway seats and knocking them unconscious, apologising the whole time. 

Parker’s unintended creepiness, apologetic harmfulness and head-spinning bewilderment at his own power is a useful metaphor to think about another set of influential nerds: the technological geniuses building the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’.  


Sudden power, the inability to exercise it responsibly, collateral damage and a need for restraint – it all sounds pretty familiar when we think about ‘killer robots’, mass data collection tools and genetic engineering.   


This is troubling, because we need tech designers to, like Spider-Man, recognise (borrowing from Voltaire) that “with great power comes great responsibility”. And unfortunately, it’s going to take more than a comic book training sequence for us to figure this out. [http://www.ethics.org.au/on-ethics/blog/november-2018/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-–-but](http://www.ethics.org.au/on-ethics/blog/november-2018/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-–-but)",a1dy72,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/a1dy72/with_great_power_comes_great_responsibility_but/
1797,Thoughts on Cooperate and the Lenovo/IBM Thinkpad,"Hey r/tech,

I just want to have a discussion about cooperation always using the Lenovo/IBM Thinkpad as their default laptop.

I personally **loathe** the Lenovo thinkpad.  Here are the reasons:

- The FN key being in the lower right hand corner instead of the CTRL key, it completely fucks up my work efficiency.

- The window key is made so much smaller in the keyboard layout, also destroy my work efficiency (I uses windows key shortcut very often).

- The red button as a mouse...  I personally never uses it, so the fact that it's there just bothers my typing.

- While this doesn't really bother me, the extra set of left/right mouse button on top of the touchpad is just completely useless to me.

- Thinkvantage... I personally think this is the biggest gargabe of all time.

- The battery life bar showing at the task bar...  While you can turn it off, I question the need for it in the first place.

Besides all that, coorperate also likes to force people to use Windows XP.  I have been a contractor for quite sometime, therefore I've been in multiple coorperations.  Almost all of these companies are still using windows xp, coupled with outdated thinkpad.  This is absolutely unacceptable.  In one of the companies that I worked in, the tech person told me that the acceptable start up time for these computer is 10 minutes.  **10 fucking minutes**.

1798,Announcement to let you know about two new updates to the subreddit,"Hey /r/tech, 

Welcome, new subscribers. We appreciate the fact that you're here. We come to you today with two significant updates to the subreddit.

---

First, and probably the most noticeable is the added list of related subreddits that we've added to the top of the subreddit. We intend for this subreddit to serve as a hub or jumping off point for people interested in technology and this list will serve to funnel them into smaller and more narrow subreddits that cater to more specific interests. I'd like to give /u/hero0fwar a public shout out for helping us with our CSS.

I'm sure many of you are wondering why your favorite gaming and science related subreddits are not included, and the reason for this is that there are gaming and science related defaults and these defaults should (and do) link to more narrow subreddits and already serve this purpose. 

We're also limited to how many categories that we have. Any more than around 6 (what we have now) and it starts to become unreadable at lower horizontal resolutions.

We also have a hard limit on the number of actual characters that we can fit in our sidebar. 

[So we created this exhaustive list](http://www.reddit.com/r/tech/wiki/related). Shout out to /u/CustardFilled from the /r/buildapc IRC for putting together the list. This list is also included in the general category under ""more...""

This list should be editable by anyone with 50 karma in the subreddit. Please keep the list nicely organized and formatted if you'd like to make changes. If you do mess something up, however, don't worry. It can always be reverted. Just send us a quick modmail if you don't know how to do it yourself. 

--- 

The second thing that we wanted to talk about is that we've tapped /u/TheGreatInquisitor to handle our **weekly** tech politics recap thread. He seems like a quality guy and although I suspect we're all unathletic nerds here we can at least appreciate a well run subreddit like /r/chicagobulls. 

So we wish him luck. You'll see his first weekly post on Saturday morning.

1799,"Gather 'round, Children, it's story time.","Once upon a time, you could image a hard drive with a Microsoft operating system to another drive, and it would work perfectly. I know this sounds bizarre but it is absolutely true.

Technologists would pirate MS products left-and-right, and take their knowledge to businesses, who would license them. This was a good time for everyone, including Microsoft. Their business of repackaging the same Office suite year after year was lucrative, and their company yielded the richest CEO on the planet. Microsoft was happy, people who used their products personally were happy, businesses were happy. Everyone was happy.

Then came Windows 95. This was the first time Microsoft introduced *The Registry*, and with it, the concept of indisposable system files that couldn't be simply moved to a new image. It was also the first OS that was aware of the hardware it was running on, and required a DRM key to activate when it detected enough hardware had changed out from under the OS-layer. Technologists did their best to adapt, but it started going downhill right **there**.

Fast-forward to today. I'm wondering what I'm still doing supporting Microsoft software. When a hard drive starts to go, it's no longer as simple as moving the data to another drive and fixing corrupted dll files. This used to be so easy, Microsoft. Why is it that Linux distributions, which nobody is making money through direct development and sales, able to do this simple, rudimentary task, and the most cutting-edge Windows technology has lost it? Why, after Google lit the path to righteousness by selling ads around their free (as it should be) software? Why is it seventeen years later, and I'm still hopeful that the ""Fix startup problems"" option on my Windows 7 disk will actually *fix startup problems* instead of wasting a half hour of my time?

To top it off, every time a business buys Microsoft products, they're subsidizing dick moves like Microsoft's lame attempt to make the web a proprietary technology (Internet Explorer).

Fuck you, Microsoft. I'm no fortune teller, but I can predict your future. Take your Windows Phone and shove it up your ass.

1801,"Non-obvious learnings in launching current startup, after co-founding 2 startups that were acquired and 1 IPO","I posted on here before when we first launched, I wanted to update you guys on some of the learnings we’ve had.

I feel compelled to share this. I'm addicted to building products people want to use. Most people think that once you have a few wins under your belt, it's easy sailing for the next startup. I think that's only partly true. Here's some context and what I think of as non-obvious learnings.
I built my last venture-funded startup to $18M in revenue a year and was acquired. We then took the acquirer public (NYSE: TRMR). I'm now back building my next startup [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech). 
 
**Team-building** - This gets easier, as you know who the good people are at early stages and who you have chemistry with. However, if you work with the same people you have been successful with, the strengths of having the flow and chemistry sometimes might translate into the weakness of not being paranoid. You don’t want to be stuck on a certain wavelength of thinking and not add fresh blood into key conversations. I have seen this occasionally and it’s subtle. This way of thinking brought us success before, so it’ll work again this time. Not necessarily true. 
 
**Finding Product / Market fit** - Experience and calcified assumptions can be a bad thing. You tend to think less disruptively if you are not as wide-eyed. One of the learnings we had early on when starting the current company was to find a space with problems we were intimately familiar with as users and passionate about solving, but not a domain we knew much about in terms of how things were done. This way, we didn't feel shackled by assumptions. Our pain point for remote collaboration. We weren't as productive as we wanted to be on existing video conferencing systems. A lot of innovation was in supporting as many users as possible in a session. We thought for teams looking to get things done, there was little innovation in amplifying team's productivity. So we built [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech), a video conferencing platform with productivity tools on top. What was a bit non-obvious was that we have to reset ourselves to have a lot of humility in testing assumptions and re-building our network of contacts.
 
**Fund-raising** - This gets easier too since we are credible entrepreneurs with wins. That said, the surprising thing is sometimes we get questions around if we were too experienced and not wide-eyed enough. Raising too much money can turn into a downward spiral as you might be tempted to spend too much too quickly and lose the discipline that comes with a small budget.  
 
**Distribution Model** - This was probably the biggest learning. Our current business was very different than our last one. How we get to customers is extremely different. The times have also changed - how users buy certain types of software have also started to transition from field sales to inside sales and self-service. Getting up to speed here took time. We used to have a field sales driven organization that was expensive to build. Now, we are innovating on self-service to make cost of sales much lower. 
 
**Mindset** - This is probably the most important. Thematically, you just have to have a scrappy mindset again. You have to fight every dollar spent and get every dollar in. Question every assumption. Vet every investor and potential hire.
 
Overall, there’s a little grain of truth to the old line “the more experience you have, the less you know”, especially in a fast-changing segment. You just gotta keep your head steady and assume nothing.

1802,Reddit 101,"## What is reddit, really?  

* Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of ""sub""reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.  

* By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of [""default"" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.  

* Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the ""unsubscribe"" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of ""similar subreddits"" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further! 

---  

## Tips for your account.  

* [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!  

* [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!  

* Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.

## What is the sidebar?  

* The [""sidebar""](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to ""subscribe/unsubscribe"" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.  

    **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

* You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.

* Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.  

---

## Who are moderators? What do they do?  

* Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  

* Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!  

## Who are admins? What do they do?  

* [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.

* The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.  

---

## What is reddiquette?  

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.  

---  

## Help! What happened to my post?  

* reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*  

    * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*  
    Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.  

    * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*
    Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.

---  

## I have a great idea for a subreddit!

* Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them  

## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!

* Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins  

## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?  

* That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  

* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  


---

## What if I need help with something else?

1803,[META]Clarification needed on allowed submissions,"A month ago this sub [ruled that submissions should be ""about innovations and changes in technology.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/23z2c2/announcement_new_rules_and_the_future_focus_of/) They also clarify in that post that ""Submissions that are not related to innovations belong in /r/technews. If a post is political, it should go in /r/politicaltech or /r/politics."" In that announcement the front page of /r/technology was shown as an example of how political that sub had gotten. 

Take a look at our front page now. It may not be *quite* that homogenous, but at the time of this posting, the top 25 posts include:

* (#1) FCC net neutrality protest: Throttle your website’s traffic
* (#2) New Internet Explorer zero-day details released after Microsoft fails to patch
* (#4) EBay admits hack, asks all users to change passwords
* (#7) Latest stats show Comcast/TWC merger will cap 79% of broadband subscribers
* (#13) Vimeo unveils “Copyright Match” system to remove infringing videos
* (#19; same topic as #1) In the market for an ISP, what are my best options both in terms of speed, value, and morals. By morals, I mean I don't want to pay a company that's trying to squash out net neutrality. Are there any good guys that offer a decent connection?
* (#21) California approves test of self-driving cars on public roads | Ars Technica
* (#23) Dubai police use Google Glass to crack down on traffic violators
* (#24; same topic as #4) EBay issues, then deletes call to change passwords
* (#25) Google is now the most valuable Brand in the World.

I really do find all these topics interesting, but I can find them elsewhere. What I'm most interested in is new technology and research that will open the door for more new technology, and that's why I subscribed to this subreddit.

I know for a fact that this sub *does* remove posts that break this rule; I thoughtlessly posted ""[The Internet of Broken Things: Why Tech’s Best Minds Are Very Worried](http://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/25yivk/the_internet_of_broken_things_why_techs_best/)"" a couple days ago, and it was removed and the rule was quoted. And I was happy, because that was my mistake: this sub isn't the place for that.

But a lot of other posts slip through. While I think more moderating would help -and mods,  I appreciate what you have done thus far- I think readers probably should be doing more to help by reporting these submissions to the mods. If it is a rule, then I think it should be enforced. If it's more open to interpretation than we were lead to believe, then it needs to be either clarified or changed. 

Also, to quote the announcement thread again:
> This should not be interpreted as a blanket ban on all things political, but the politics in the subreddit should be limited to significant changes in tech law and current events. When news breaks and we notice an uptick in threads about a political subject, we will make a mega thread for everything to be discussed in a central location instead of allowing it to dominate the entire subreddit.

I haven't seen these threads yet; it's probably time to make one about net neutrality at least.

Finally, the reason I chose to post about this instead of just pm the mods is because of the sub's commitment to transparency, and because I believe the community would like to help decide how to handle this issue. If we really want to have these political/newsy discussions, then the rule needs to change, because right now there's a double-standard on what's acceptable and what's not in this sub. If not, then we should see these threads getting removed.

I don't wish to be negative; I certainly appreciate the effort made here to be transparent and focus on innovation rather than news. Thanks for your interest; any comments and criticisms are welcome.",2687y0,11,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/2687y0/metaclarification_needed_on_allowed_submissions/
1804,Rant on INVISIBLE SELFIE CAMERAS ... and What They SHOULD BE Focusing on instead!,"**Anyone else pissed at the fact that mega corporations have been spending their time, money and human resource on this superficial tech for the past 5+ years ??? .** Jesus Christ!! All this JUST SO THAT WE CAN TAKE A SELFIE. ??  Stop telling us that *'this is advancement in mobile technology'.*  Who asked for this? Who???? You are just creating artificial Needs and Wants ! You are shoving this down our throats. **Even for a die hard selfie addict this tech will NOT change their experience.** Next year, smartphones companies will have this on their flagship, and demand a frigging premium price for it while ignoring stuffs which THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON.

Here are so areas i wish phone companies spent their time and resources on. Now dont tell me these are *'difficult and too challenging*' . Tech companies can do the unimaginable if they are motivated enough. So, the stuffs i would like them to focus on are

1. **Display tech that does not strain the eyes.** Yes, please think about our health. How about an anti glare anti UV or what not eye protection tech. Changing the color temp to warm only helps us to a limited extent. Add another layer within LCD Display which will have that digital ink thingie. When we wanna simply read stuffs, it will be like a Amazon Kindle. When we wanna watch videos and play games, we switch back to color display. We have OLED technology, how about me merge these two. Both these tech revolves around switching ON -OFF its pixels. Shouldn't be tough.
2.  ***Battery life***. I get it, thermodynamics and shit is a hindrance, but there are tested and proven successful technologies like S**olid State Lithium Ion, Gold Nano-Wire, Zinc-Air.**... and many more which i read about like 10+ years ago, in some tech magazine (yea, back when tech magazines was a thing). We all know that if companies pull these techs out of the universities and bring it to their labs and work on it, they can make these techs a reality for mass market consumption.
3. ***Use Periscope Lens for Selfie camera.*** This tech first appeared in Huawei P20, and now Oppo has adopted it. They use it for zoom function, but **how about we use it to divert the light from the front camera lens, and into the rear sensor.** They selfie camera would be just a light receiver. The real VIEWING and Processing of light will be done by the main rear camera . We can have a hardware toggle or software based toggle.
4. ***Use the rear panel of the phone as a Heat dissipater.*** This idea comes from the flat area in a computer processor, where we put thermal paste and attach a cooler. We cant have fans in phones, so just let the back panel of the phone act as something that can release the heat.  Imagine this scenario---, we have two CPUs, neither have a CPU Cooler attached. On CPU #1, we put a plastic/glass sheet on top . On CPU #2  we leave it open. Both will run hot, but CPU#1 will get hotter. This CPU#1 is what happens to our mobile phone SoC. Instead of confining it, how about we let its heat dissipation area be EXPOSED  through the rear? OK i may be wrong in the **physics** sense, but its  just my  layman idea.
5.  **BRING BEZELS BACK!**  Yeah, i said it. We need convenience and functionality. We need to be able to use our phones with the least **finger gymnastics.**  Who here enjoys using those curved displays on smartphones?? You have to be carefull how you hold the phone. WHY!!!! WHY DID WE MAKE THINGS HARDER FOR OURSELVES???If we bring bezels back, we can stop companies from wasting time on stupid  technologies like  IN-DISPLAY FINGER PRINT SCANNERS and NOTCH/PUNCH HOLE DISPLAYS and other techs which has ACTUALLY MADE OUR LIFE WORSE. Yes, you all may not see it, but our mobile phone **experience** has been degrading for the past few years. We are no longer able to do things we could do before, we need to realize that, we are brainwashed to believe that life is improved, when its not. INCONVENIENCE should never be called INNOVATION or FEATURE. We ranted on the '*innovations*' brought by Windows 7, so why cant we do the same for mobile tech??
6. **USER-REMOVABLE COMPONENTS.** I am sure you all see teardown videos of smartphones, on YT channels like JerryRigEverything. We want to do the same thing but with minimal tools and effort. The only thing stopping us from prying the components out are the adhesives. We had smartphones with removable batteries that were slimmer than the competition! Remember Galaxy S4 ? i owned that shit and i used it for 4 years because i could swap the battery, ALL ON MY OWN. Why do we still use *neanderthal technologies* like a GLUE in the 21st century?? Cant these tech companies come up with a solution that ensures components stay in place without GLUE??

I could go one and on, but i can see this RANT is already too long and ppl might get bored.

1805,Why Phone Cameras Cannot be DSLR Cameras [discussion],"It's the same thing every year. Apple, Google, and Samsung launch their flagship phones, and people go wild over the cameras. Soon enough, we hear someone saying the death of the DSLR camera is near. But are these smartphones really catching up to DSLRs? What makes a DSLR better?

It takes only one look at a comparison in output to know that phones aren't yet good enough. And it makes sense once you find out what are the important specs in any digital camera.

Sensor Size Does Matter

The biggest difference between a DSLR camera and a smartphone is the sensor size. And that alone is enough to create that chasm. Till phones have sensors that match those of DSLRs, it's silly to think the output will be as good.

The sensor is the base technology of how a camera works. Its job is to capture all the light coming in through the lens. The larger the size of the sensor, the more light it can capture. The more light a sensor can capture, the more detailed and true your photos look.

Typically, a DSLR camera's sensor will be one of the following:



Full Frame: 36 x 24 mm

APS-C: 23.6 x 15.6 mm

1.5-inch: 18.7 x 14 mm

Mirrorless cameras have 4/3-inch (17.3 x 13 mm) sensors

Top point-and-shoot cameras (e.g. Sony RX100 II) feature 1-inch sensors

Want to take a guess at the sensor size of smartphone cameras? The Google Pixel 2, arguably the best smartphone camera today, has a sensor measuring 1/2.6 inches (5.5 x 4.1 mm).

So a DSLR's sensor is anywhere between 4-6 times larger than a smartphone's sensor.


Stop Counting Megapixels

Even if the camera's sensor size is larger, its megapixel count might not be as high. The Nokia 808 PureView famously had a 41-megapixel camera, but the sensor size was only 1/1.2 inches.

But its pictures pale in comparison to the Canon EOS 1300D or Nokia D3400. Both these DSLR cameras have APS-C sensors at only 24 megapixels. So how do they have better pictures even with megapixels?

Well, you shouldn't believe in the myth of megapixels. Marketers push this statistic because it is a number that can be manipulated easily. The truth is, cramming more megapixels onto a sensor alters the image quality.

In fact, less pixels on a larger sensor result in larger pixels, which in turn capture more light. And this means the image processor will reduce noise.

The Unsung Hero: Image Processor

The sensor's job is to capture light and turn all the colors into electronic signals. But the result is something akin to a jigsaw puzzle of different color signals. The image processor is the unsung hero who takes those colors and builds an image out of them.

This image processor is the ""brain"" of the camera. It has to read the light meter, access and understand colors available in the sensor, check the time of capture, and smartly put together the puzzle. The accuracy of what you see with what photo you get is as much the function of the processor as any other part.

This is a tough job for any image processor. And this is why you sometimes see ""noise"" in photos. ""Noise"" is a wrongly placed pixel of color in finishing the jigsaw puzzle. The image processor also has more important jobs (like the Bayer transformation for speed) but those are too technical to get into here.

Now think about it this way. A DSLR has an image processor whose job is to understand photography and nothing else. It's a dedicated worker whose entire life is about putting together accurate images.

Meanwhile, smartphones also have image processors, but these work along with a whole lot of other circuitry. And they have limited space to work on the limited size of a phone. It's no surprise that a dedicated DSLR image processor does a better job than smartphones.

Aperture, Shutter Speed, Lenses, and More

Apart from the sensor size and the image processor, smartphones still haven't caught up in other aspects. The lenses, for example, are still primitive compared to DSLRs. Of course, you can change lenses and you get much more control on DSLRs. But apart from that you only get wide-angle lenses on phones. (This is mainly because a wide-angle lens will increase the sensor size in that limited space.)

Smartphones have done better with aperture and shutter speed, the basics of a camera. The new lot of iPhones and Pixels manages f/1.8 aperture, which is comparable to mirrorless and DSLR cameras.

Apart from lenses though, you can expect smartphones to make rapid progress over the next few years. There aren't major long-term physical restricting the introduction of better camera technology on phones. It will just take time.

Do You Think Phones Can Replace DSLRs?

Today, hobbyists and travelers should buy mirrorless cameras over DSLRs. But the raging topic these days is whether phones will get there soon.

Do you think smartphones can ever replace DSLRs? Has your phone already made you forget about your big old camera?

As long as I am dishing out the cash for something like this I would like for it to be comparable with my phone (Galaxy SIII), but it's not a must.

1962,Big Tech Test in Russia,"Big Tech has taken meaningful steps to slow the Russian military invasion and Russian leadership's mass communication tools, but there's still a big question of what role those companies played in bringing the world to this perilous moment.  While never an official arm of the Russian state, social media and companies like Google/YouTube and Apple provided the vehicles to confuse, distract, and, when necessary, enrage Russian citizens (and populations abroad), eroding democracies and democratic processes while deterring meaningful international intervention against rising autocracies.  Whatever happens in Russia and Ukraine, democracies won't be safe until the Big Tech business model is rewritten to one that doesn't profit by  misinformation, outrage, and personal data.

2010,USA-China new digital Cold War?,". Huawei, among other items, makes a key product called radio access networks, (or RANs) the part of a telecommunications system that connects phones to telco networks through radio connections including base stations, antennas, chips and controllers. Besides Huawei, the RAN business, (which is about $76 billion in annual sales,) is dominated by Samsung (Korean), Ericsson (Swedish), Nokia (Finnish) and ZTE (also Chinese and also at loggerheads with the U.S. government.)

The Trump administration at first began telling allies in Europe that buying Huawei technology posed a national security risk, though with no hard evidence. That gained little traction. “The message was ‘trust us,’ but that is not a strong suit from this administration,” says an industry source. But what if the argument was framed in terms of economics, this source continued. If Huawei and ZTE gain more and more market share then the non-Chinese suppliers, which like all companies in the sectors need to spend billions of dollars of capital .
Trump’s early approach was to bully and threaten U.S. allies like Germany and the UK to abandon Huawei.   It didn’t quite work. And when the Trump administration has blocked the export of U.S. tech to China, the Chinese have responded maybe not the way Trump anticipated. “Rather than confront any U.S. restrictions, what they’ve basically done is make stronger efforts to try to reduce reliance on imported technologies, particularly U.S. ones. That seems to be part of the broader multi-year strategy that they’re implementing,” says Bruce Kasman, chief economist and managing director of global research at JPMorgan Chase.
And the Trump administration has moved to ban TikTok, which now has 80 million-plus monthly active users in the U.S. A key bone of contention here: Money, money, money. that,      this is a rivalry which will define societies; education, culture, the military,     and in the end personal freedom and responsibility.",juejmd,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/juejmd/usachina_new_digital_cold_war/

2024,Free Degree of Computer Science using MIT OpenCourseware,"I want to create a study team to do the MIT Challenge. I created a curriculum of 180 credits and I'm thinking in achieve it in 1 year and somethink like two months. I can help you in all you need related to this, the schedule, books, etc. There's a slack team where we all share. (THIS IS JUST FOR KNOWLEDGE, MIT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A REAL DEGREE)

EDIT 15/04/2017 Link to the curriculum that I made: [MIT CHALLENGE CURRICULUM](http://imgur.com/QwigriC) 

What I did before starting and some tips:

  1. I planned it for a month due to several things. I'm from Venezuela and I have my own company. I live of the money that I make. So I bringed a friend to my company and make him a business partner with the condition that he has to do all the work. This was perfect since I'm doing 8 hours per day of study. 

   2. Another thing that is important and people forget it; a good CHAIR. If you're going to spend 8 hours every day, 4 hours on weekend, a  good chair is an important thing and not just a furniture.

   3. I made a lot of noise of what I was about to do with my friends and family in order to make this challenge a real thing and keep a little of pressure on me.

   4. Economic situation here in my country is ugly, so it's not common to have your own house, even if you have money. So I live with my family and they make a lot of noise, luckily for me, my house is not small and I fixed a room-garage just for studying and work.

  I studied an intensive week of pre-calculus before starting just to remember some math that I forgot

Are you suited for this?

 * People who is interested in Computer Science

 * People with time to learn Computer Science, this may not be a formal degree but you should take it like one

 * People with discipline

 * People friendly and willing to collaborate

 * People wanting to be tech-entrepeneurs

What do you need? 

 * A computer, basically any computer will work. 

 * Time for spend 6-9 hours a day depending on your effort 

 * A good chair to spend those hours 

 * Willingness!


A little thing about me: I studied Philosophy first and then Economics in college, I never finished none of them. I started my own company and that was my life three years until now. I always hated school and college, but I never hated to learn. So I started to see that I didn't need the traditional educational system to learn. That's when I heard about the MIT CHALLENGE done by Scott H Young. Inspired by him, I made my own curriculum and my own structure on how to accomplish this, I'm going to write later some rules that I made for this.

The rules that I made to give some structure (Test mode):


1. 12 hours/unit on every subject, MIT recommend 14 hours/unit. Scott H. Young did 6 hours/unit

2. If you don't understand something you may go to a prior subject in order to understand the premise.

3. It is supposed that a subject with 12 units (like most of them) should be done in 3 weeks, working on them 8 hours monday to friday and 4 hours each day of the weeknd, to a weekly total of 48 hours and a 3 weeks total of 144 hours. If something unexpected happens you can rearrange your time to compensate this in other days, but the total hours should be done in 3 weeks with just a few extraordinary exceptions. It is to be seen if this methodology will work.

4. If Rule #3 is broked, you will have 5 days more to finish the total hours, but with a new total of 14 hours per unit to a total of 168 hours in a 12 unit subject

5. You should have at least 180 units when you're done (This is what MIT consider a Major). This could be consider that the Major is complete (If there's no a thesis or final project)

6. (It is to be seen if it is possible to have a few days free between the subjects)

7. The general way to test your knowledge will be through the final exam if this is possible. If you fail in this test you will have two days to study for a similar test gain, and this way so on if the resources allowed it. It is to be seen what would happen if the resources are not available.




   Two days ago I started with my first subject, Introduction To Computer Science and Programming in Python. I'm going to test if it's possible to finish this first subject within the time that should be done and if I can keep with the hours per day. I'm starting to see that the feedback when you're doing programming problems would be nice with another students.
Note: I want to add that my native language is NOT english, so there are things that are a little harder for me to understand while studying than to a native english speaker.

Note 2: I want to clarify that many of the subjects are electives that you can choose.

EDIT 16/04/2017: A Slack Team was created for people who wants to do the challenge. Everyone who joins to the slack team are encourage to look first the two posts, ""Team Community Rules"" and ""General things about this team and the Challenge"" in the channel #general_rules, then you can proceed to start in the #how_to_start channel

EDIT: I noticed that some people have taken this post bad, saying it's impossible, etc. By no means I'm trying to diminish the value of people getting degrees at colleges, if it sounds like that I apologize. This is a post solely to create a team that really believes that this can be done. The benefits of self educations are many as the benefits of traditional education are many too, it depends on what you are looking for and your context. Not everyones lives in developed countries nor everyone has the money to afford a good education. The 3 weeks estimated time is just that an estimated, the evaluations are there for something, to test your knowledge. If a subject doesn't have the evaluations I encourage you to look for other options, like asking teachers to help you with that. And if it takes you more than 144 hours or 168 hours is OK, if MIT would have said that you need 20 hours per unit I would have place an estimatted effort of 240 hours for a 12 unit course instead of 168 . But you need to have a goal and a standard time in order to keep you motivated. A degree on MIT has 360 credits, in this challenge we are just studying for the major in CS 180 credits + Calculus and two Physics. Also you're free to learn different subjects at the same time, I just prefer to study one at a time.",65nr7p,175,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/65nr7p/free_degree_of_computer_science_using_mit/

2034,Does Nintendo's partnership with NVIDIA point to something more? Could NVIDIA plan on allowing the NX to use its GRID system to stream games over the internet?,"You guys know a bit more about this than me probably....would this be possible?  Outside of NVIDIA expanding their GRID network would anything else need to be done to allow this?  I assume it would be subscription based, and will be rolled out slowly.  

-----------------------------
------------------------------
---------------------------------
------------------------------------
The rumor by Eurogamer saying the console will contain a tegra chip is the most likely rumor to be true so far, which has a lot of people pissed off and are saying its a nail in the coffin for Nintendo for not offering a more powerful system.....What if they partnered with NVIDA not just for its chip, but also to use its GRID network and have NVIDIA and Nintendo both profit from it?

NVIDIA offers its game streaming thru its SHIELD which hasnt sold well, maybe they could plan on using the same game streaming service on an updated network with the NX?  Even if the NX sells bad it will probably sell better than the SHIELD.

This will allow for the NX to display better graphics than the NX hardware is capable of.  They would gain lots of third party support, which they have a problem with, because third party companies would essentially just be releasing their PC versions for NX...it would cost them nothing or next to nothing to have their games on NX(except for paying Nintendo and Nvidia to allow it).

**EDIT:** Also if the tegra rumos are true, Nintendo is probably judging the backlash in the gaming community.  So if they didn't plan on using the GRID network, I am sure they are at least trying to convince NVIDA now or soon that they should partner to offer the service thru NX in the future.

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

**Here are some rumors and business decisions that I think kinda point to this...**

**Rumors about the NX working with PC's and other consoles....**

- Possibly talking about running PC games, and the ability for many console gamers to crossplay with PC users...Meaning that NX users could play something like rocket league with ps4 players and something similar on newer crossplay xbone games.

**An NVIDIA chip being used in a console, which hasnt happened in a long time.**

- Could be NVIDIA being competitive and offering chip cheaply, but I think it points to a much larger partnership.....NVIDIA has the best game streaming network....they want to gain more subscriptions especially after the poor sales of the shield console and Nintendo wants third developer support, which brings me to next point...

**Third party devs, such as Witcher 3 creators, said they are super excited for what they have seen with NX...**

-  when they shouldnt be if the NX can only run Tegra-level graphics.  They sound really enthusiastic like they are not just playing nice with nintendo.  They would have to make entirely different games for a system that might or might not fail if it was designed to run on Tegra...thats a lot of money to invest.  Running PC versions to display to the NX costs developers nothing...These DEVS would not be excited if they knew they would have to create separate games designed for high end tablets!  Its like developing something for the original Wii when compared to the 360!  They would not be so enthusiastic and excited if they knew they couldnt easily transfer their games over to new hardware!  And the main witcher 3 DEV sounded extremely enthusiastic and helped to make one of best looking games ever, and they dont make a lot of games...He should be terrified if they knew the NX only ran on a tablet GPU!  I dont think he was just excited to release the gwent card game!

**Rumors about the docking part being released months after the mobile part.**  

- May take longer for Nvidia to expand network, maybe the docking station has a better display output that allows games to put out at 4k on TVs....Nvidia might want to judge how popular the streaming service will become first by judging it on portable version....requires a lot more bandwidth to display at higher resolutions(Grid 2.0 allows 1080p, but they will eventually want to do it at higher resolutions).  Might be that NVIDIA doesnt have network to display higher resolutions to so many people at first, fact that most people dont have 4k tvs would also make sense why nintendo would hold back on releasing a docking station that increases video output, has better wifi, and ethernet port.

**Nvidia's investment in their game streaming network and the failure of their SHIELD console...**

- NX will sell better than shield even if it sells as bad as Wii U, maybe NVIDIA wants to make more money thru subscriptions and not enough people are buying shields to make it as lucrative as they expected.  When Nvidia discussed its GRID 2.0 update the spokepersons mainly aimed toward remote desktop and running high end application over the internet usually...way less focus was put on the gaming portion, could be that they are giving up on shield but maybe its because they are upgrading their network for reasons they cant say yet publicly....because they hare going to mainly shift their shield gaming subscription service over to the NX!  Thats a lot more people using it, a lot more servers required, and a lot more money they make!

--------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

Anyone into gambling?  Putting odds at 50% it uses NVIDA game streaming services to offer a subscription based or rental type model to play high quality PC games, and it will only work through the docking station and only be offered at home with those with capable internet.  Will also be rolled out slowly and incrementally at first, with plans to have it everywhere within a year or so...

**Just seems like a business partnership made in heaven....Nvidia has the network but cant sell enough hardware to gain or keep users...Nintendo has a history of having shit internet but has the ability to easily outsell the SHIELD.  Nintendo wouldn't have to invest in an expensive game streaming network, NVIDIA wouldn't have to invest in making a new console that might not sell well.  They could both profit heavily from this with minimal investment**

2117,Printer advice needed for small business.,"So our old brother printer is on it's last legs. We are looking for something that can fax, scan, print, and copy. THERE ARE SO MANY PRINTERS TO LOOK THROUGH. Jeeze is it overwhelming. I was wondering if anyone had nay personal experience with a printer they would recommend, or knows of a certain printer that would fill the bill.

What we are looking for:

1) Print, can, fax, copy

2) Low cost per page. Our last printer was a gas guzzler.

3) Color. If possible able to be used to print postcards/posters. Essentially a machine that can be used for 
printing advertising related materials. This is less essential, as we can use a print service, but it would save us some money.

4) A decent print speed. Our current printer takes a good two minutes just to warm up. I hate it.

Any help would be much appreciated!",1l9fuf,7,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/1l9fuf/printer_advice_needed_for_small_business/

Looking at Japanese train stations and financial infrastructure—even their *toilet seats*, for goodness sake—makes me wonder where we went wrong, how we fell so far behind.

2199,Tech patented by Google,"I'm studying engineering in Norway, and i really want to start a project while taking my degree. I came across a patent (that will remain undisclosed) owned by google. Note that there is no market for this yet.

So, to cut to the chase, I'm wondering whether or not it's worth working with as it's something that has enormous potential (in my eyes), but as previously mentioned, the patent for it is owned by google. My initial though was just to leave it, but i can't get my mind off it.
I though I might work with it and perhaps write by bachelors thesis on this, and potentially make it into a business and compete with google when it reaches the market.

Any thoughts if it's possible to make a business out of it when they launch their products? Or should I just do it as a project? 

Edit: To be clear, I'm not trying to rip them off. I just want some information whether it's possible to compete once they launch their product.

2213,Facebook Might Not Be Free Anymore...,"In 2008, when registering to become a member of social networking site Facebook, the first slogan that caught the eye of network users was the slogan (""[It's free and always will be](https://electrodealpro.com/silently-changing-the-slogan-facebook-is-about-to-stop-free/)"") (roughly translated: Free and always like that). Having been on Facebook's homepage for more than a decade, the famous tagline is right under the Account Signing button, emphasizing the ""free"" element of the social networking platform.

However, in an unexpected move, the tagline slogan was silently changed to ""[It's quick and easy](https://electrodealpro.com/silently-changing-the-slogan-facebook-is-about-to-stop-free/)"", according to a recent discovery by Business Insider.

Using the website photo storage tool Wayback Machine, the site discovered the changes made by Facebook between August 6-7. Although Facebook has not yet provided an official explanation for this change, but according to Bussiness Insider, these may be new steps of Facebook.

Up to now, Facebook has always affirmed that users will not have to pay any fee when registering to become a member on social networks. Instead, the platform operates and benefits from an ad-based business model.

In addition, Facebook's previous slogan ""Free and always will be"" actually contradicts the platform's policies. Specifically, in Clause 11 of the ""Things to Know"" section, Facebook asserts **""We cannot guarantee that the platform will always be free"". =>Muhahahahahaha**",cwoh4d,0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/cwoh4d/facebook_might_not_be_free_anymore/
2214,"Which company will fall first: Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft?"," The first could be either Google or Facebook.

**Google** and **Facebook** are extremely reliant on data and control a sizable chunk of our personal data. And they both are incredibly valuable without which many of us cannot imagine our lives. Their survival would be in threat precisely because they deal with an extremely important resource.

Given the importance of the data and how governments are elected/toppled with it, there will be increasing regulations in the next few years. The data is too important for its power to be ignored by the corridors of power. Think of what happened to them in China. What if other governments also treat them that way?

A few decades ago people could not imagine the world without **AT&T**. They controlled all the communication in the USA. Their technology was so valuable and their hold on the market so big, that they were eventually broken up into baby bells. AT&T never regained its pole position in technology.

That could happen to **Google** or **Facebook**. At some point regulations could come out to make the data a shared resource that all companies could use. And increasing regulations on how this data is used.

They might not go completely out of business, but might not be in the same pole position as they do today.

Compared to Google and Facebook, what **Microsoft** and **Apple** produces are fairly less important to the society. You can easily live without an **iPhone** or **Azure**. Thus, there will be lesser regulatory pressure on them.

That said, Apple being in the fashion business will find it hard to keep making devices that people like. Two or three bad models in a row could put Apple out of the market \[*the company itself might survive with the cash and reinvent to do something else*\]. This is what happened to Nokia - they dominated the phone market and then disappeared from the market.

Microsoft is a tough nut to crack. It survived the US government trying hard to break it. It survives the great firewall of China - something other US companies have not been able to. It survived a concrete attack by almost everyone else in the tech business. It survived Steve Ballmer. It creates something important, but not too important.

That said, **Amazon** might be the hardest to dislodge as theirs involve building a large logistics chain that is going to be needed for a long time.

2215,Big Tech Test in Russia,"Big Tech has taken meaningful steps to slow the Russian military invasion and Russian leadership's mass communication tools, but there's still a big question of what role those companies played in bringing the world to this perilous moment.  While never an official arm of the Russian state, social media and companies like Google/YouTube and Apple provided the vehicles to confuse, distract, and, when necessary, enrage Russian citizens (and populations abroad), eroding democracies and democratic processes while deterring meaningful international intervention against rising autocracies.

2217,Technopreneur Without The Technology,"A very wrong assumption around the world is that in order to be a technology entrepreneur, one should be able to write complicated codes or invent something that the world has never seen. I can share from personal experience that nothing can be further from the truth.

This is the reason why people with the most brilliant ideas never even consider jumping into the technopreneur space because the thought is, ""How can I be a technopreneur when I can't even code?"" However, the reality is you don't need to know how to code at all. In order to be a technopreneur, the one and only thing required is an idea -- an idea that changes, improves and redefines the way business gets done.

The art of thinking, creating and expanding businesses is all about innovation. The good news is that innovation is not limited to first-movers. Google did not build the first search engine. Amazon was not the first online store. Facebook was not the first social networking website. However, at this time, these are some of the most profitable companies on the planet.



Why You Don't Need To Know How To Code To Be A Technopreneur

Here's the simple answer: Innovation is different from the invention. Inventing something means creating something that has never existed. Innovating means solving problems with tools that already exist. And innovation is the key to entrepreneurial success, not invention. So there's no need to be an inventor. Instead, being an innovator with a business idea is enough to make a successful technopreneur.

Can you take the leap of faith? Lots of potential innovators have ideas, but very few can articulate or sort out how to effectively bring those ideas to life. Having traveled across 50 countries and spoken at hundreds of conferences, I've met a lot of people full of great ideas, yet they are very skeptical and hesitant to execute. The potential of those ideas is sometimes so immense that I hate to see them go to waste, which is why I started my own incubator and investment program to help entrepreneurs who may lack technical expertise.

Steps To Becoming A Technopreneur

• Find the right partner: My first piece of advice for any young entrepreneur is to find partners who have the abilities that you lack. If you are a techie, find a marketing expert. If you are a business guy, find a tech partner. If you have nothing, go find a team that has techies, marketers and managers. But whatever you do, don't let a great idea go unexecuted -- never leave it to rot. With the opportunities available today, I believe it is an absolute sin to consider shortcomings as limitations.

• Double down on your skills: Develop expertise in whatever business function that you choose to do yourself. Your contribution to the project in terms of skill has to justify your role in the project and with the team. Whatever role you decide for yourself, ensure that any challenges regarding the role can be resolved solely by you, but never hesitate to ask for help. The team will depend on your problem-solving ability regarding your skill, so never let them down.

• Learn to lead: Once you have the right partners and have brushed up on your skills, it's important to remember that leadership will be a real test any entrepreneur will have to endure. Weak leaders are bad entrepreneurs. Be the first one to accept responsibility and the last one to assign blame. Inspire discipline in the team and inspire confidence from the customers. Companies with weak leadership will always fall as tough times in business are inevitable. Learn from mentors and experienced professionals to develop leadership abilities by following them on social platforms and reading their books.

• Accept failure and rejection: Even the most successful entrepreneurs have had to face a lot of rejection and failure. Sometimes unexpected legal complications, staff resigning, insufficient funds and partners leaving midway are something I have personally dealt with. But never let it be the end of your entrepreneurial journey. If your employees leave, hire new ones. If your partners leave, find someone else. If you run out of funds, bootstrap or borrow to restart. Accept these instances as part of the process. Entrepreneurship is not for everybody and challenges are the filter to separate the wheat from the chaff.

I followed the same steps to build my business and help many others achieve success. Becoming a technopreneur happened just along the way. Get rid of the excuse that non-techies can't build tech companies. Once you get over the mental block that only techies can build successful tech companies, your probability of creating the next Amazon or Facebook will increase exponentially.

Don't forget -- a little over a decade ago, half of the most valuable organizations in the world were oil companies. Now it's all technology -- Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook.

2222,Google RCS chatbot,"Full context at bottom if needed.

I was asked to create a very basic Google RCS chatbot. I started doing it in Google's ""Dialogflow"" when things started to get confusing:

1. I noticed that on top of ""Dialogflow"", Google has a seperate [platform for RCS](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/rcs-business-messaging) and now I'm not sure which one I should be using. I can't seem to use the new platform as [this page says](https://jibe.google.com/early-access/) I have to contact their partnet to request early access. If I do a regular google sign-in on the first page, it just redirects me back to the same page.
2. In Dialogflow, testing works fine if the bot responds with regular text. If it's an RCS then it doesn't work and I'm not sure where I can test that?


&nbsp;



&nbsp;

&nbsp;


If it helps, this is the **full context**:

I'm a sysadmin in a tiny company that deals with phone numbers databases. Since RCS seems to become a thing, there was some talk at the top of ""getting in the game"". A very generous telecom company has agreed to involve us in their demo platform. I was asked to create a super dummy RCS chatbot to get things going - enough to fill the requirements ([this excel sheet](https://i.imgur.com/ZqreI6Q.png)). If everything goes to plan then we'll probably hire someone more experienced to build what we need.

This is a little overwhelming to me because there is just no info online. At first I thought that these chatbots are built with ""Dialogflow"" but now I see there's a early access platform which I can't seem to understand how to get or if that's what I need. To get things more confusing I can't seem to request the early access going. I'm not even sure how I can test the chatbot I created with Dialogflow because their on-site testing only works for text.",i7qqu2,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/i7qqu2/google_rcs_chatbot/

I read this article today and it made me sad how much effort Huawei is making just to stay alive as a company. The Huawei case has shown China is in an emergency situation that is as dire as not having a nuke while a Nuclear power is threatening.

US can destroy China's phone companies overseas business anytime by just switching off Google. Its not just appstore. Most Android apps rely on Google Play services. Chinese companies will be doomed without it.

US can force Taiwan or other companies to cutoff supplies to any Chinese company by threatening to put them into entity list. Again, this means even Samsung or TSMC might stop selling their chips. That will destroy these companies even at home.All Chinese phone, Laptop or any type electronics companies are under huge threat.

Huawei is trying to develop alternatives to Google services such as Maps library and Huawei Core to replace Google Play services. But can such effort be successful if Huawei is the only one using it?

Huawei will not be that successful when other chinese companies still use google apps and services. It will create unfair disadvantage for Huawei since most app makers will not have the incentive to support them when its only Huawei having a different platform. This is the same problem Windows phone faced and ultimately failed. And these other chinese companies like Xiaomi will not take the tough decision and sacrifices needed to get rid of US dependence as long as they are not also banned.

Can Huawei designed instruction set be successful if Xiaomi still uses ARM? No, sadly. it will be losing business massively.

Huawei laptop business is over due to Windows ban. Can a Huawei developed laptop with a different OS be ever successful even in China, when every other Chinese company makes laptop with windows? 

There should be a combined effort among these companies to create one common system used by all chinese companies. There should be a few powerful system companies for things like Chip instruction set, Operating sytem and Phone App store instead of the current separate effort by everyone at the same time that ultimately will fail due to fragmentation.

Chinese govt should make this effort to force these companies to make sacrifices now. There should be a requirement of using atleast 30% or whatever percentage of phones or laptops that must be released with a chinese made OS or chip or app store.  There should be effort to create companies for systems where all these phone or electronic companies will have joint ownership.

Companies will only focus on short term gains and ultimately lose. China must make effort to create a long term safety.

Huawei should not fight alone. Xiaomi and Oppo and others should help and create one Chinese alternative end-to-end system instead of fighting among each other.",dt7phx,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/dt7phx/china_is_making_a_huge_mistake_by_letting_huawei/
2225,Is Apple on the brink of decline (again)?,"Sorry for the stupid title - but I've just read a comment on a Hungarian site (http://tinyurl.com/3ktq2bq) that I think really hits the nail, and could interest some redditors. I've translated it below.

""Apple was always an innovative company, as it is today. But innovation is not enough. Business model is more important. Apple created the Windows-style OS, but Microsoft became the world's largest software company with Windows. Not because it was a better product, but because they opened the platform and thousands of companies (both hardware and software) became interested in spreading the system. Apple Mac was keen on doing everything itself. The result was a good, but pricey system, that could only compete with the multitude of Windows apps in some areas. It became the product for a small, niche market.

iPhone and iPad is on the same way. They're innovative, very good, but they're closed, and Apple bans everything that would risk its total control (see Adobe Flash, limited carrier and retail distribution, forcing of iTunes etc). The obvious enemy this time is Android, another open platform that mimics the innovative products of Apple, but with much more and cheaper (often free) content. People may want an iPhone, but will buy Android. Only time will tell, and Apple's market share will start to decline seriously. This won't be a problem until the market grows, but when everyone will have a smartphone, Apple will start to get hurt. The iPhone was the king of the hill for a year, but competitors showed clones only months after the iPad's first appearance. Apple is a good company, but could be more succesful business-wise. But it won't be, until Jobs fights with the world instead of cooperating with it.""",j95m8,4,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/j95m8/is_apple_on_the_brink_of_decline_again/

On the surface, there has seemingly never been a better time to launch a sustainable offering. Consumers—particularly Millennials—increasingly say they want brands that embrace purpose and sustainability. Indeed, one recent report revealed that certain categories of products with sustainability claims showed twice the growth of their traditional counterparts. Yet a frustrating paradox remains at the heart of green business: Few consumers who report positive attitudes toward eco-friendly products and services follow through with their wallets. In one recent survey 65% said they want to buy purpose-driven brands that advocate sustainability, yet only about 26% actually do so.

I ask because I am getting a business degree and a tech store was something I wanted to own when I was younger. Just a thought that passed through my mind.

2230,"Gather 'round, Children, it's story time.","Once upon a time, you could image a hard drive with a Microsoft operating system to another drive, and it would work perfectly. I know this sounds bizarre but it is absolutely true.

Technologists would pirate MS products left-and-right, and take their knowledge to businesses, who would license them. This was a good time for everyone, including Microsoft. Their business of repackaging the same Office suite year after year was lucrative, and their company yielded the richest CEO on the planet. Microsoft was happy, people who used their products personally were happy, businesses were happy. Everyone was happy.

Then came Windows 95. This was the first time Microsoft introduced *The Registry*, and with it, the concept of indisposable system files that couldn't be simply moved to a new image. It was also the first OS that was aware of the hardware it was running on, and required a DRM key to activate when it detected enough hardware had changed out from under the OS-layer. Technologists did their best to adapt, but it started going downhill right **there**.

Fast-forward to today. I'm wondering what I'm still doing supporting Microsoft software. When a hard drive starts to go, it's no longer as simple as moving the data to another drive and fixing corrupted dll files. This used to be so easy, Microsoft. Why is it that Linux distributions, which nobody is making money through direct development and sales, able to do this simple, rudimentary task, and the most cutting-edge Windows technology has lost it? Why, after Google lit the path to righteousness by selling ads around their free (as it should be) software? Why is it seventeen years later, and I'm still hopeful that the ""Fix startup problems"" option on my Windows 7 disk will actually *fix startup problems* instead of wasting a half hour of my time?

To top it off, every time a business buys Microsoft products, they're subsidizing dick moves like Microsoft's lame attempt to make the web a proprietary technology (Internet Explorer).

Fuck you, Microsoft. I'm no fortune teller, but I can predict your future. Take your Windows Phone and shove it up your ass.

2231,Time to Act on Net Neutrality,"Now that there have been over 1 million signatures on Net Neutrality Petitions (see below), we now need to act to bring more pressure on Congress.  

For those that are U.S. citizens and residents, please [contact your congressional representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) requesting them to support Net Neutrality.  This is especially important for small business owners who have Republican representatives.  Please explain how Net Neutrality will hurt small businesses.

All small business owners should write to [The National Federation of Independent Business](http://www.nfib.com/about-nfib/) asking them to lobby congress to support Net Neutrality.

U.S. residents can also write opinion letters and articles for their local newspapers.  (This has been reported by many to be the most effective way to get your congressperson's attention.)

Foreign nationals should contact representatives in their governments to apply political pressure on the U.S. explaining how a biased internet could affect innovation and international trade.  You can also write opinion articles to large U.S. papers explaining the effect on innovation and international trade.  (Some good papers would are The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, and the Washington Post.)

In all correspondence, please mention the petitions and how many people have signed them.

Also, if you have not done so, you can sign the online petitions.  They don't take a large time commitment to sign and every signature will help bolster the arguments made through all other channels.

Petitions:

2245,Does Nintendo's partnership with NVIDIA point to something more? Could NVIDIA plan on allowing the NX to use its GRID system to stream games over the internet?,"You guys know a bit more about this than me probably....would this be possible?  Outside of NVIDIA expanding their GRID network would anything else need to be done to allow this?  I assume it would be subscription based, and will be rolled out slowly.  

-----------------------------
------------------------------
---------------------------------
------------------------------------
The rumor by Eurogamer saying the console will contain a tegra chip is the most likely rumor to be true so far, which has a lot of people pissed off and are saying its a nail in the coffin for Nintendo for not offering a more powerful system.....What if they partnered with NVIDA not just for its chip, but also to use its GRID network and have NVIDIA and Nintendo both profit from it?

NVIDIA offers its game streaming thru its SHIELD which hasnt sold well, maybe they could plan on using the same game streaming service on an updated network with the NX?  Even if the NX sells bad it will probably sell better than the SHIELD.

This will allow for the NX to display better graphics than the NX hardware is capable of.  They would gain lots of third party support, which they have a problem with, because third party companies would essentially just be releasing their PC versions for NX...it would cost them nothing or next to nothing to have their games on NX(except for paying Nintendo and Nvidia to allow it).

**EDIT:** Also if the tegra rumos are true, Nintendo is probably judging the backlash in the gaming community.  So if they didn't plan on using the GRID network, I am sure they are at least trying to convince NVIDA now or soon that they should partner to offer the service thru NX in the future.

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

**Here are some rumors and business decisions that I think kinda point to this...**

**Rumors about the NX working with PC's and other consoles....**

- Possibly talking about running PC games, and the ability for many console gamers to crossplay with PC users...Meaning that NX users could play something like rocket league with ps4 players and something similar on newer crossplay xbone games.

**An NVIDIA chip being used in a console, which hasnt happened in a long time.**

- Could be NVIDIA being competitive and offering chip cheaply, but I think it points to a much larger partnership.....NVIDIA has the best game streaming network....they want to gain more subscriptions especially after the poor sales of the shield console and Nintendo wants third developer support, which brings me to next point...

**Third party devs, such as Witcher 3 creators, said they are super excited for what they have seen with NX...**

-  when they shouldnt be if the NX can only run Tegra-level graphics.  They sound really enthusiastic like they are not just playing nice with nintendo.  They would have to make entirely different games for a system that might or might not fail if it was designed to run on Tegra...thats a lot of money to invest.  Running PC versions to display to the NX costs developers nothing...These DEVS would not be excited if they knew they would have to create separate games designed for high end tablets!  Its like developing something for the original Wii when compared to the 360!  They would not be so enthusiastic and excited if they knew they couldnt easily transfer their games over to new hardware!  And the main witcher 3 DEV sounded extremely enthusiastic and helped to make one of best looking games ever, and they dont make a lot of games...He should be terrified if they knew the NX only ran on a tablet GPU!  I dont think he was just excited to release the gwent card game!

**Rumors about the docking part being released months after the mobile part.**  

- May take longer for Nvidia to expand network, maybe the docking station has a better display output that allows games to put out at 4k on TVs....Nvidia might want to judge how popular the streaming service will become first by judging it on portable version....requires a lot more bandwidth to display at higher resolutions(Grid 2.0 allows 1080p, but they will eventually want to do it at higher resolutions).  Might be that NVIDIA doesnt have network to display higher resolutions to so many people at first, fact that most people dont have 4k tvs would also make sense why nintendo would hold back on releasing a docking station that increases video output, has better wifi, and ethernet port.

**Nvidia's investment in their game streaming network and the failure of their SHIELD console...**

- NX will sell better than shield even if it sells as bad as Wii U, maybe NVIDIA wants to make more money thru subscriptions and not enough people are buying shields to make it as lucrative as they expected.  When Nvidia discussed its GRID 2.0 update the spokepersons mainly aimed toward remote desktop and running high end application over the internet usually...way less focus was put on the gaming portion, could be that they are giving up on shield but maybe its because they are upgrading their network for reasons they cant say yet publicly....because they hare going to mainly shift their shield gaming subscription service over to the NX!  Thats a lot more people using it, a lot more servers required, and a lot more money they make!

--------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

Anyone into gambling?  Putting odds at 50% it uses NVIDA game streaming services to offer a subscription based or rental type model to play high quality PC games, and it will only work through the docking station and only be offered at home with those with capable internet.  Will also be rolled out slowly and incrementally at first, with plans to have it everywhere within a year or so...

**Just seems like a business partnership made in heaven....Nvidia has the network but cant sell enough hardware to gain or keep users...Nintendo has a history of having shit internet but has the ability to easily outsell the SHIELD.  Nintendo wouldn't have to invest in an expensive game streaming network, NVIDIA wouldn't have to invest in making a new console that might not sell well.  They could both profit heavily from this with minimal investment**

Another option is to get a hotspot device like the Verizon Mifi and use it exclusively in the car for the dash cam so any dash cam with WiFi compatibilities will be accessible. This route will require a standalone battery pack.

Nowadays, the manufacturers are too busy fighting for the camera quality which is understandable but to be frank, 1080p at 60 fps is the best optimal build. I say this because most 4K dash cam usually overheat way too fast.

2253,USA-China new digital Cold War?,". Huawei, among other items, makes a key product called radio access networks, (or RANs) the part of a telecommunications system that connects phones to telco networks through radio connections including base stations, antennas, chips and controllers. Besides Huawei, the RAN business, (which is about $76 billion in annual sales,) is dominated by Samsung (Korean), Ericsson (Swedish), Nokia (Finnish) and ZTE (also Chinese and also at loggerheads with the U.S. government.)

The Trump administration at first began telling allies in Europe that buying Huawei technology posed a national security risk, though with no hard evidence. That gained little traction. “The message was ‘trust us,’ but that is not a strong suit from this administration,” says an industry source. But what if the argument was framed in terms of economics, this source continued. If Huawei and ZTE gain more and more market share then the non-Chinese suppliers, which like all companies in the sectors need to spend billions of dollars of capital .
Trump’s early approach was to bully and threaten U.S. allies like Germany and the UK to abandon Huawei.   It didn’t quite work. And when the Trump administration has blocked the export of U.S. tech to China, the Chinese have responded maybe not the way Trump anticipated. “Rather than confront any U.S. restrictions, what they’ve basically done is make stronger efforts to try to reduce reliance on imported technologies, particularly U.S. ones. That seems to be part of the broader multi-year strategy that they’re implementing,” says Bruce Kasman, chief economist and managing director of global research at JPMorgan Chase.
And the Trump administration has moved to ban TikTok, which now has 80 million-plus monthly active users in the U.S. A key bone of contention here: Money, money, money. that,      this is a rivalry which will define societies; education, culture, the military,     and in the end personal freedom and responsibility.",juejmd,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/juejmd/usachina_new_digital_cold_war/
2254,What's The Feasibility Of A Personalized Startup Tech Newsletter?," A major problem that I feel needs a solution is how the pace of technology is accelerating far past the rate of startup adoption. For example, new innovations in industries such as AI, Cloud Computing, SaaS are evident but only after time do these tools/technologies get adopted on a wide scale by low-resource, early stage startups. This is because of the countless number of options that these startups have and how they might feel overwhelmed and just stick with what's popular.

A humble approach I want to take to promote discovering startup technology is to create a personalized startup newsletter where early stage tech startup founders can fill out a form on my website about their size, startup stage, and tech interests in regards to what their startup is doing ( e.g., machine learning, virtual reality or blockchain) in order to be suggested about 3 free, low-cost tools once or twice a month that would matter to them (picked by relevance). I plan on serving as a free outlet for business targeting startups to reach their target startup audiences. For example, a SaaS startup with a novel project management tool would be able select the type of startups they feel they can help most and if I feel confident about their offering, I will add their product to the newsletter.

2. Twitter Acquired Lucky Sort:
    As reported by TechCrunch, Twitter acquired BigData Visualization startup- Lucky Sort- for an undisclosed amount. It is one of the strategic acquisitions by Twitter to boost its revenue from advertisement business. Twitter can leverage it directly to analyze its own data for different decision making capabilities and later on to bring BigData Solutions to other Social Media Houses too. Noah Pepper, CEO of Lucky Sort has posted a congratulatory message on the company website confirming the acquisition.

3. IN-FLIGHT DIGITAL MAGAZINES:
All bigger names in aviation have started to serve Digital Magazines and Newspapers to improve their In-Flight Services .When Newsweek, in January 2013, decided to go completely digital, I tried to evangelized the scope of usage of Digital Magazines and posted a Tweet mentioning the areas like Healthcare, Aviation etc. As pointed out by Airlinetrends.com,this has already started trending in aviation sector.In an effort to offer passengers a much wider range of news and reading option, instead the bunch of newspapers and magazines currently available airlines such as Air France, AirBerlin, Virgin Australia and ANA have started to provide passengers with access to digital Newspapers and Magazines before their flight leaves.

2257,Explaining the scale of Huawei's problem,"Huawei is not only a smartphone vendor, neither a Cisco-like networking company. This company is much bigger than that. It belongs to the very closed circle of 4 large-portfolio telecom vendors. Others include Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE (another Chinese).

Huawei has an annual turnover of $100 billion from hundreds of customers worldwide. Their equipment are in the radio part, optical cables, wireline access, radio microwave, power systems, core networks, and others. If Huawei collapses, hundreds of telecom operators will have to spend huge sums (could go over $1 trillion) to swap their networks. Some parts are not too critical and can wait few years. But in many cases, action has to be taken immediately.

Where's the problem then? Not all of the operators will be able to find the necessary financing to rebuild their networks. Tens of them will go bankrupt, or nationalized. Those who can get the financing will face another problem: the manufacturing capabilities of the other vendors cannot be sufficient in the short and middle terms to meet the requirement. 
Let's say Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE are delivering 50,000 radio equipment per year. Suddenly, they're required to deliver 1 million. It will take them months to adapt their supply and manufacturing chains. Such an effort will require setting up temporary massive production lines at a very high cost.

This trillion dollars new market emerging from thin air will make huge profits for some and huge losses to others. Some third world countries will see their telecom ecosystem collapsing, so they will seek urgent financing from the IMF and the World Bank, then from international banks. Conditions and rates will not matter, and the consequences on their sovereignty will be painful.

What about the end users? The cost of Internet and mobile services will skyrocket, making them non-affordable to hundreds of millions of people. There will be much less people on the social media, taking their business model to the ground. Internet may look more like the end of the 1990s, with IRC and free niche forums.

The geopolitical consequences is another troubling dimension.",bsxlup,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/bsxlup/explaining_the_scale_of_huaweis_problem/
2258,Imessage is the biggest reason I'm wary of switching from my Iphone.,"So I'm an 18 year old girl, in college (though out for summer), and so most of my friends use iMessage. I literally can count the people who don't on one hand, and none of them are the people I talk to most frequently. I'm not one of those crazy people who will block an android user just not to see green bubbles, but I have noticed that texting is far more annoying even when just texting a friend who's an android user (missed messages, incomplete messages, etc). I know there are messenger apps like Kik and WhatsApp, but at least in my social circle, nobody uses them for day to day easy texting! 

&#x200B;

I really love the design of the Google Pixel 3, because it reminds me of the same feeling I got when my first iPhone (4S) came out and everything was new and fun and innovative. I'm not deep into the apple ecosystem at all (refused to get anything other than a PC because I love gaming and I'm learning code, besides I grew up on windows) but I do feel kind of stuck with Apple. Prices for the new iPhones seem super crazy, especially since this will be the first year I buy my own phone (I hope this doesn't make me sound spoiled I'm just trying to show you guys everything that's going on) and $1,000 is a shit ton when the only jobs I can get for the moment are a little above minimum wage in my state ($7.25/h). Yes, I could save up for it...but I don't want to feel stuck when buying a new phone man. 

&#x200B;

Imessage is by far my favorite part of my apple device. I'm a big texter, and easily sharing photos and videos in good quality is nice. Groupchats are important asf in college, and while a lot of them are on Groupme, there are considerable amounts made by smaller groups (ex: my business school team chat). I've actually seen people go out of their way to exclude android users in these situations, making one groupchat for the person with the android so they can see important messages and then making an iphone groupchat to joke around and stuff in with vids and photos easily as well as configure groupchat settings itself. I suppose it could be FOMO, but it sucks when the FOMO is also kind of important for maintaining connections with everyone whether they're a best friend, a friend, or an acquaintance you're just getting to know.

2259,"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of a Hyper-Connected World","Hello people!

I am new here. I just wrote an article regarding how tech is affecting us. Looking forward to constructive criticism and creating a discussion.

 

## The Double Edged Sword

Ever asked yourself if technology is a blessing, a curse or maybe both? Ever thought that it’s a double edge sword and there is a price to be paid? I think so. I am convinced that everything in life has a price – even technology.

While technology has given us great experiences and has made our lives a lot easier and convenient, it has also robbed us of our private lives, attention span and our physical health. It is obvious that the world today was not prepared of the impact of technology and how rapidly it advances. This leads to depression, anxiety, lack of self-esteem or purpose. Studies done in the UK lead us to believe that there could be another [health epidemic](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/the-loneliness-epidemic-more-connected-than-ever-but-feeling-more-alone-10143206.html) in the near future.

So let us review the good, the bad and the ugly when it comes to being constantly connected to the world. 

 

## My Personal Experience

Before we compare, I want to take you on a journey. A journey back in time. Let me take you to 2010. I finished 7th grade and we had a final goodbye party since everyone is going their own way in life, from changing schools to pursuing their dreams. It was the last time to be together, so as you can imagine it was pretty emotional for everyone.

I remember very clearly when me and the boys left the party together and said our goodbyes – one of them said I should download this thing called Facebook. They told me it will help me keep in touch with everybody after we split. I heard the word Facebook a few times before but I was never really interested in getting it – until now. It was a very emotional moment.

The first thing I did when I got back home was to make an account and start adding my friends on Facebook. And that was my entry into Social Media – to keep in touch with my friends and share our experiences – who will turn into a doctor, or a business owner or just become lazy.

But ironically it had the opposite effect. It actually separated us, I only kept in touch with a very few friends. We kind of grew distant from each other more and more. We never really spoke, we just……watched and liked our photos and that was it. The connected world *actually separated us apart.*

## The Good

Let’s discuss the good things about a hyper-connected world. Its not all doom and gloom when it comes to technology. Today’s world is more connected more than ever before. We can reach anyone, anywhere at any time. Your relatives across the planet are just a click or tab away.

Before the internet the only way to connect to friends and family from very far away was to send mail (no, not email – that didn’t exist yet!)

Usually it will take weeks or even months to reach its destination plus you had to be an exceptionally good writer (I am a terrible writer so I could not write a proper mail to anyone anyway). Now, traditional mail has been almost completely replaced by email. You can send an email to anyone in the world instantly! This is great for businesses because it has saved them so much time and money and has made communication between departments and offices around the world so much easier.

One of the other advantages is that everything is convenient. Technology like [digital wallets](https://ddwj9.app.goo.gl/BLA6) and [virtual cards](https://icard.com/en/virtual-cards?utm_source=masterclass&utm_medium=nyor) has allowed us to do things that previous generations can only dream of like paying bills online, working from home, ordering products and food online. This allows us to focus our time into doing productive things (I’m looking at you Programmer – too busy to get off your chair to get food so you just order it online). Yes, I am poking fun at the programmers because I wanted to become one myself. I started a Programming course recently so wish me luck!

I think the biggest plus of all is this - information. Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge! For the first time ever, we have the world’s entire knowledge at our finger tips.

The Internet is arguably one of the greatest inventions we have created. It as impactful as the steam engine, the industrial revolution and the creation of the wheel. All of these inventions forever changed humanity and the internet is no different. It allows any person that is connected to access an uncalculatable amount of knowledge and information.

Now, you do not need to invest thousands into a degree, you can learn everything you need online (with a few exceptions – Doctor, lawyer ect.). You can research any topic, ask people all around the world and join communities to learn. We truly live in a connected world where the possibilities are only limited to your imagination.

## The Bad

Now let’s talk about the negatives. One of the biggest complaints that we hear today is that people are too addicted to their devices. They cannot let go and are constantly hooked on their feeds. Ex-Facebook CEO has [stated](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/11/facebook-former-executive-ripping-society-apart) that our addiction to technology and being constantly connected is ripping societies apart.

Attention spans have [plummeted](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/culture-shrink/201812/is-social-media-destroying-our-attention-spans) ever since Social Media became mainstream and young people today are have serious trouble paying attention in class. A study shows that if a I page loads a second slower than normal can result in 11% fewer page views, 16% decreased customer satisfaction and 7% lost conversions.  Another valid argument is that due to easy access to information, people do not try to learn things – rather they just ask Google whenever a question pops up. This discourages learning and acquiring new skills as it has been shown in numerous [studies](https://theconversation.com/is-technology-making-us-dumber-or-smarter-yes-58124). Being connected to everyone and everything has just made people complacent and lazy. Why should I try to learn if I can just ask Alexa to do it for me, but Alexa can’t think on your behalf buddy.

## The Ugly

I was really hesitant if I should go this far, but in the name of informing people, I decided to go all in. Thanks to our hyper connected world, it has made it easier than ever for criminal organizations to operate. The Internet has a dark underbelly, known as the Deep Web where you can find anything your illegal heard desires. Stolen Credit Cards, illegal substances, black market dealings and even assassins for hire! From the limited information we know about the dark web, some analysts suggest that some sites make around [500,000$ a day](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kbzme9/the-biggest-dark-web-markets-rake-in-up-to-500000-a-day-study-says)! Sounds scary right? These services and products wouldn’t be so easily available if our world was not hyper connected. Google estimates that it has only [indexed around 0.004%](https://www.seeker.com/how-much-of-the-internet-is-hidden-1792697912.html) of all pages on the web. We have no idea what is hiding in the other 99.996%, we can only imagine (to be honest a part of me doesn’t want to know). Maybe we will never find out what is really lurking out there.

## A bright future or a Matrix scenario?

Technology has its good sides and bad sides. Our connected world could help us achieve things that have been considered science fiction like Virtual Reality, Drones, Artificial Intelligence and many more. On the other side we might become slaves to technology and be eventually replaced (it is more [real](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/does-technology-replace-h_b_424073) than you think). Only time will tell, but I can assure this – it is not going to be a boring process. We will see some amazing advancements in our lifetime like Clean Energy, finding cures to deceases, increasing quality and life expectancy and many, many more. l consider myself lucky that I am living in this age to see it. I hope you are too.",ic710y,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/ic710y/the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly_of_a_hyperconnected/
2260,Do any of the Tech Journalists hanging Google out to dry for Search Plus Your World even know what it is or does?,"Did ANYONE read what SPYW is or does? you get Google plus search results above other results ONLY when you're searching inside Google+ This is what I EXPECT to find when I search inside google plus. Not one person flips out when you type in someone's name in the search box on Facebook and the person they're looking for pops up. If this applied to ALL google searches, then sure, flip out... but it makes no sense to get angry because a search inside a social network returns results from that social network.... And you can't fault them for not including results from two other networks that continually close doors in their face. They tried to get Facebook integration and Facebook sided with Bing. They did live feed with Twitter before they even HAD a Google+,and Twitter pulled the plug on the API without warning. you can't base your business around the interaction with services you don't control AND that have given you reason NOT to trust in their stability or availability.

If you don't want Google plus results showing up in your searches above other relevant material... don't do your searching in a social network's search box INSIDE a social network. If you want ALL of your social networks to show up in this feed, then complain to the other social networks that are closed in and refusing to share their social information instead of blaming the company that has done nothing but campaign and labour for a free OPEN internet since it's inception.",owgl1,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/owgl1/do_any_of_the_tech_journalists_hanging_google_out/
2261,Stupid Solar FREAKEN Roadways,"Do you understand anything about glass manufacturing? The cheapest way is to make large flat and very smooth sheets, and even this is still expensive and requires a huge amount of energy.

First you have to 'float' the glass over molten metal to achieve the gloss finish.

Secondly you have to cut those sheets into whatever size you need(straight lines and square angles are quickest, cheapest and produce less waste)

Thirdly you have to polish the sharp edges otherwise the glass will explode in the toughening plant

Fourthly you toughen the glass by [a]heating it in a huge(and very expensive) oven, then [b] cooling it gradually. This process hardens the outside of the glass, similar to the crust on a flapjack/brownie, but not the inside. This is why safety glass explodes into tiny pieces. 

got that?

Excellent, so now that the glass has been toughened, you have a very limited ability to polish(AKA:grind down) the glass before the integrity is lost and the glass explodes. 

The process to make uniform patterned panels is massively more expensive. You then still need to toughen the glass and then you can do other expensive processes to make the glass stronger. 

After all this, a busy and dusty road would cause the glass to wear down and lose its integrity and shatter within minutes. With each exploded panel the problem will be compounded and the road would turn to very expensive and very toxic gravel within seconds.",27h85w,0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/27h85w/stupid_solar_freaken_roadways/
2262,Free Degree of Computer Science using MIT OpenCourseware,"I want to create a study team to do the MIT Challenge. I created a curriculum of 180 credits and I'm thinking in achieve it in 1 year and somethink like two months. I can help you in all you need related to this, the schedule, books, etc. There's a slack team where we all share. (THIS IS JUST FOR KNOWLEDGE, MIT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A REAL DEGREE)

EDIT 15/04/2017 Link to the curriculum that I made: [MIT CHALLENGE CURRICULUM](http://imgur.com/QwigriC) 

What I did before starting and some tips:

  1. I planned it for a month due to several things. I'm from Venezuela and I have my own company. I live of the money that I make. So I bringed a friend to my company and make him a business partner with the condition that he has to do all the work. This was perfect since I'm doing 8 hours per day of study. 

   2. Another thing that is important and people forget it; a good CHAIR. If you're going to spend 8 hours every day, 4 hours on weekend, a  good chair is an important thing and not just a furniture.

   3. I made a lot of noise of what I was about to do with my friends and family in order to make this challenge a real thing and keep a little of pressure on me.

   4. Economic situation here in my country is ugly, so it's not common to have your own house, even if you have money. So I live with my family and they make a lot of noise, luckily for me, my house is not small and I fixed a room-garage just for studying and work.

  I studied an intensive week of pre-calculus before starting just to remember some math that I forgot

Are you suited for this?

 * People who is interested in Computer Science

 * People with time to learn Computer Science, this may not be a formal degree but you should take it like one

 * People with discipline

 * People friendly and willing to collaborate

 * People wanting to be tech-entrepeneurs

What do you need? 

 * A computer, basically any computer will work. 

 * Time for spend 6-9 hours a day depending on your effort 

 * A good chair to spend those hours 

 * Willingness!


A little thing about me: I studied Philosophy first and then Economics in college, I never finished none of them. I started my own company and that was my life three years until now. I always hated school and college, but I never hated to learn. So I started to see that I didn't need the traditional educational system to learn. That's when I heard about the MIT CHALLENGE done by Scott H Young. Inspired by him, I made my own curriculum and my own structure on how to accomplish this, I'm going to write later some rules that I made for this.

The rules that I made to give some structure (Test mode):


1. 12 hours/unit on every subject, MIT recommend 14 hours/unit. Scott H. Young did 6 hours/unit

2. If you don't understand something you may go to a prior subject in order to understand the premise.

3. It is supposed that a subject with 12 units (like most of them) should be done in 3 weeks, working on them 8 hours monday to friday and 4 hours each day of the weeknd, to a weekly total of 48 hours and a 3 weeks total of 144 hours. If something unexpected happens you can rearrange your time to compensate this in other days, but the total hours should be done in 3 weeks with just a few extraordinary exceptions. It is to be seen if this methodology will work.

4. If Rule #3 is broked, you will have 5 days more to finish the total hours, but with a new total of 14 hours per unit to a total of 168 hours in a 12 unit subject

5. You should have at least 180 units when you're done (This is what MIT consider a Major). This could be consider that the Major is complete (If there's no a thesis or final project)

6. (It is to be seen if it is possible to have a few days free between the subjects)

7. The general way to test your knowledge will be through the final exam if this is possible. If you fail in this test you will have two days to study for a similar test gain, and this way so on if the resources allowed it. It is to be seen what would happen if the resources are not available.




   Two days ago I started with my first subject, Introduction To Computer Science and Programming in Python. I'm going to test if it's possible to finish this first subject within the time that should be done and if I can keep with the hours per day. I'm starting to see that the feedback when you're doing programming problems would be nice with another students.
Note: I want to add that my native language is NOT english, so there are things that are a little harder for me to understand while studying than to a native english speaker.

Note 2: I want to clarify that many of the subjects are electives that you can choose.

EDIT 16/04/2017: A Slack Team was created for people who wants to do the challenge. Everyone who joins to the slack team are encourage to look first the two posts, ""Team Community Rules"" and ""General things about this team and the Challenge"" in the channel #general_rules, then you can proceed to start in the #how_to_start channel

EDIT: I noticed that some people have taken this post bad, saying it's impossible, etc. By no means I'm trying to diminish the value of people getting degrees at colleges, if it sounds like that I apologize. This is a post solely to create a team that really believes that this can be done. The benefits of self educations are many as the benefits of traditional education are many too, it depends on what you are looking for and your context. Not everyones lives in developed countries nor everyone has the money to afford a good education. The 3 weeks estimated time is just that an estimated, the evaluations are there for something, to test your knowledge. If a subject doesn't have the evaluations I encourage you to look for other options, like asking teachers to help you with that. And if it takes you more than 144 hours or 168 hours is OK, if MIT would have said that you need 20 hours per unit I would have place an estimatted effort of 240 hours for a 12 unit course instead of 168 . But you need to have a goal and a standard time in order to keep you motivated. A degree on MIT has 360 credits, in this challenge we are just studying for the major in CS 180 credits + Calculus and two Physics. Also you're free to learn different subjects at the same time, I just prefer to study one at a time.",65nr7p,174,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/65nr7p/free_degree_of_computer_science_using_mit/
2263,All in one - global media access (taxed?),"I initially thought of posting this on r/thinktank or r/brainstorming but they are dead, and r/science only allows linking to published papers. Feel free to suggest a better sub than this if you know one.  


Convenience is king. All day.   
I'm from europe and almost all roads are public. Let me drive now, tax me later. It works just fine.  
Same with most infrastructures, water, electricity, etc.  
I don't know why this couldn't be the case for social media and virtual platforms too.

So... competition is said to be beneficial, but everyone hates logging in to a dozen different services to consume music, media, watching movies or playing games, have ""pay2use"" speedbumps and required logins etc. The goal (dream) here would be to have instant easy access to every virtual service, like browsing any page - but without ads and optional login/profiles. Seperate platforms would remain as they are best suited, optimised and with customisable interfaces and user preferences; for example steam for gaming, netflix and youtube for music, movies, shows and user generated content. Yes, there are a lot of problems, regional laws, politics, etc., let's dig into those later.   
The idea is to have everything ever made in ""one"" place, online. There shouldn't be anything like private ownership on something with extreme popularity and of high cultural value, so that it could be pulled or deleted just ""because I can"" said the owner. All of the things should be available for everyone, unedited, raw, with all the different versions, etc. 

You could download any music/ movie/ game(if possible) and play it later. No online streaming or presence required.  
You can login, set up your preferences, create a profile and lists, save custom settings, interact with the community and other users, contact creators, rate, vote, etc., all optional. Or you can hit the site/app you want and consume whatever without any of the above. You like a song and want to hear it right now? Click and go. No ads. You can even lock your phone and have the playlist go on. No bullshit. Tax me later. 

Our first problems are language and cultural barriers, so we'll be focusing on the western section for starters...   
How do we fund this? Our target market is 20% of the global population, that's NA and the EU mostly, gross 1,4 billion people. Cut \~30% (everyone under 18 and over 65) and we get a pool of roughly 1 billion tax payers.   
Progressive income based tax, the rare richest millionaires pay maybe $100-1000 a month (some sort of cap), but the monthly median citizen fee would be around $5, making more than $50 billion every year. That should be plenty to cover anything from server costs to royalties. Big brain time for all the business experts, my cost projections are based on absolutely nothing so if you have any grip on the real numbers here, let me hear you please.  

This money goes into a transparent fund, all stats trackable online open for the public.  
Published content creators/ studios/ producers get royalties paid based on total/ timely  views/ plays/ activity/ popularity.   
This should be enough motivation for companies to get their projects funded privately by displaying their stats, or apply for some sort of semi-pre-paid assistance if they provide the neccessarities. 

The second problem is freedom of speech, hot topic in a time when Alex Jones and many other get reeeeeeported and deplatformed, being targeted by the radical left that is supported by the power hungry elite and silicon valley.   
We would have to allow everyone to maintain a online presence, and let people accept to get offended and deal with it.

2264,"Non-obvious learnings in launching current startup, after co-founding 2 startups that were acquired and 1 IPO","I posted on here before when we first launched, I wanted to update you guys on some of the learnings we’ve had.

I feel compelled to share this. I'm addicted to building products people want to use. Most people think that once you have a few wins under your belt, it's easy sailing for the next startup. I think that's only partly true. Here's some context and what I think of as non-obvious learnings.
I built my last venture-funded startup to $18M in revenue a year and was acquired. We then took the acquirer public (NYSE: TRMR). I'm now back building my next startup [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech). 
 
**Team-building** - This gets easier, as you know who the good people are at early stages and who you have chemistry with. However, if you work with the same people you have been successful with, the strengths of having the flow and chemistry sometimes might translate into the weakness of not being paranoid. You don’t want to be stuck on a certain wavelength of thinking and not add fresh blood into key conversations. I have seen this occasionally and it’s subtle. This way of thinking brought us success before, so it’ll work again this time. Not necessarily true. 
 
**Finding Product / Market fit** - Experience and calcified assumptions can be a bad thing. You tend to think less disruptively if you are not as wide-eyed. One of the learnings we had early on when starting the current company was to find a space with problems we were intimately familiar with as users and passionate about solving, but not a domain we knew much about in terms of how things were done. This way, we didn't feel shackled by assumptions. Our pain point for remote collaboration. We weren't as productive as we wanted to be on existing video conferencing systems. A lot of innovation was in supporting as many users as possible in a session. We thought for teams looking to get things done, there was little innovation in amplifying team's productivity. So we built [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech), a video conferencing platform with productivity tools on top. What was a bit non-obvious was that we have to reset ourselves to have a lot of humility in testing assumptions and re-building our network of contacts.
 
**Fund-raising** - This gets easier too since we are credible entrepreneurs with wins. That said, the surprising thing is sometimes we get questions around if we were too experienced and not wide-eyed enough. Raising too much money can turn into a downward spiral as you might be tempted to spend too much too quickly and lose the discipline that comes with a small budget.  
 
**Distribution Model** - This was probably the biggest learning. Our current business was very different than our last one. How we get to customers is extremely different. The times have also changed - how users buy certain types of software have also started to transition from field sales to inside sales and self-service. Getting up to speed here took time. We used to have a field sales driven organization that was expensive to build. Now, we are innovating on self-service to make cost of sales much lower. 
 
**Mindset** - This is probably the most important. Thematically, you just have to have a scrappy mindset again. You have to fight every dollar spent and get every dollar in. Question every assumption. Vet every investor and potential hire.
 
Overall, there’s a little grain of truth to the old line “the more experience you have, the less you know”, especially in a fast-changing segment. You just gotta keep your head steady and assume nothing.

2265,Why apples decision of not including a charger adapter in iphone 12 still brings company more income,"So after we got the news of iphone 12 removing charger case in the boxes i thought like how could apple could take a dumb step how would people buy an iPhone atleast if it can't give you a charger so I browsed the internet and saw what the things apple done which people initially thought dumb but became successful later then I found out that apple was not dumb as I thought. 

So starting from scratch the iphone is the phone which changed the way we see the phone at all. With touch screen multi touch option and many features it changed the way we used to use the phones. So as with iphone 3, iphone 3s, iphone 4, iphone 5, iphone se. These iphones bought a lot revolutionary changes in iphone including fingerprint id, facetime and so on. Did you know that classic iphone 4 design including aluminum corners are not at all considered first they decided on stainless steel for low production costs but steve jobs insisted that their phones must be high quality and should last long but as soon as steve jobs died they shifted back to stainless steel. This simple incident tells us that steve jobs always wanted to bring innovation but others only wanted to make money.

So for our original topic during iphone 7 apple decided to remove it's 3.5mm headphone jack. it was the time when people getting quality earphones from companies like jbl,bose...Etc. compared to them apple in sound industry has a less impact.excluding iphone users rarely people used to buy them. So apple predicted this and they started working on truly wireless earphones. In iphone 7 launch event they said that they want to remove headphone jack just save space so that more other components can be included but in real they just kept a plastic piece there saying that it is a barometric vent. So the idea is to remove it so that later apple launches airpods. But they said they will be giving a headphone adaptor to it which in later models are removed from box and asked to purchase separately and shockingly it is the most purchased product of apple next year. So here apple created a problem by removing headphone jack and came up with two solutions 
1.buy a headphone jack
2.buy airpods
And both are basically helpful for apple only.
This made other smartphone manufactures think so that they can boost they sound industries so smart phones started to remove headphone jacks.
This is a decision which seemed to be dumb at staring but got more income to apple later.


Similarly with iphone x when whole world is busy in developing phones without bezel apple had no time to do that so they came up with notch display in iphone x and fans went crazy other companies saw that stopped their bezel less display decided to make notch dot displays. So here even if you can't build a phone apple made all companies stop building that with new tech. this is how apple plays everytime.



So for new controversy of removing charger adaptor we are getting news of xiaomi developing a 100w charger and even more. Apple traditionally include a 5w charger in their boxes which became too old. Who waits 3 hrs atleast to charge thier phone. So apple decided to remove the charger show some reasons and then will sell it separately for a increased price of course. So when other companies see this they basically think why to include a 100w charger inside a box. let's give the 100w charger support to phone but include only some 18w or 20w charger in phone. Let's separately sell those 100w charger so we can gain more profit and in that way people will see that they copied apple in selling chargers separately. It helps apple in two ways
1. They make more profits by selling chargers
2. Other companies don't include a high volt charger so apple won't be trolled for including a low specs accessoires


Either way it helps apple only


WELL PLAYED APPLE

2266,Don't Buy RCN,"Your Question: I was charged 93 dollars this month, and it is only typically 64. I was wondering why the change, and also I would like to cancel my account because I have moved.
Please wait, an operator will be with you shortly.
You are now chatting with Max P. (Customer Care) - Customer Care
14:09Max P.: Hello Millicent! I am an RCN chat representative who specializes in helping residential 
14:10Max P.: Thank you! Please give me a moment to check into this.
14:12Max P.: I do see the change in price. I need a little more time to find out the reason.
14:13me: ok
14:16Max P.: It looks like there was a discount applied to your account, but has since dropped off.
14:16Max P.: What I mean to say is that it expired.
14:18me: I was informed that the 65 dollars was the most I'd being paying for the speed....Currently for 99 dollars you get 75 Mbps I was getting 50. That is a huge difference in speed, and price.
14:18me: In fact, on your website now, in years 2-3 for 50 Mbps, it is only 59.99
14:19Max P.: That is new customer pricing. After a year, as with all companies, the price does increase.
14:19me: Yes, but that is year 3! at 59.99!
14:19me: not the first year
14:19me: not the second year
14:19me: but the third
14:20me: not a new customer price
14:20me: I have had RCN for 2 years.
14:20Max P.: I would be happy to credit the account for this month by $25 to account for the change in price.
14:21me: I am also wishing to cancel my account, can I get the $25 as a refund, or only as a credit to future charges, as I won't have any future charges
14:22Max P.: To cancel your account, you will need to call Customer Care at 1-800-746-4726. They are open 24/7. Unfortunately, I am not able to cancel services through chat.
14:23me: Thats fine, but will it be refunded or just credited? Also I would like to point out that I have been a customer for 2 years, and have been paying the 3 year price. I have been a loyal customer, and have been happy with the service, however the sudden, and unpredictable change in price, led my bank account to be overdrawn. I am very displeased with this. I think that to make good on the deal, I should be credited for the whole month.
14:24me: I feel as If i have been scammed
14:26Max P.: I am sorry you feel that way. The credit will come as a refund since you do not have a current balance.
14:27me: You understand that the 3rd year price is 59.99 yes?
14:27me: Look at my account and tell me how long I have been a customer. Less than two years, actually.
14:27Max P.: Yes, I see that.
14:28me: So, my other question, I guess is why have I been paying for the 3rd year price. And also, is it possible to get the entire month refunded, considering you overdrew my account.
14:28Max P.: Approximately 22 months.
14:28Max P.: Let me see what can be done.
14:28me: Thank you]
14:34Max P.: Thank you for being patient.
14:35Max P.: After looking further into the pricing, the discount you had was a 12-month pricing which should have been explained to you when you upgraded.
14:35Max P.: Unfortunately, we cannot refund the amount that you paid.
14:35me: can I please speak to your manager.
14:36Max P.: I have just conferred with my manager on this. There's nothing more we can do. I am still willing to credit your account the $25 I mentioned earlier.
14:36me: let me discuss it with your manager
14:37Max P.: You will still need to give us a call. At that point you can speak with a manager, as well as disconnect your services.
14:38me: That's fine. Thank you for ripping me off, and I hope you appreciate me telling everyone one I know to avoid you from now on, as well as writing negative reviews of you all over the internet
14:38me: and I will give you a call, however, you should really consider letting me talk to your manager right now.
14:39Max P.: Absolutely, give me one moment to transfer the chat over to my supervisor.
Michelle W. has joined the conference.
Max P. has left the conversation.
14:40Michelle W.: Hi Millicent! How can I help you today?
14:41me: You have the chat log of what I discussed with max, yes?
14:41Michelle W.: Yes, I do have access to the chat log.
14:41me: Ok, can you tell me how long I have been a customer.
14:42Michelle W.: I have services were active since Aug 2011.
14:42me: and once you do that, can you tell me the 22 month pricing for my current plan?
14:43Michelle W.: When you currently signed up you had the 20Mbps for $49.99.
14:43me: Tell me, the current price for 50 Mb, at 22 months
14:45Michelle W.: I am not sure what the rates were at that time for the 50Mbps. It look like on 2/25/2012 you upgraded to the 50Mbps for $64.99 + taxes.
14:45me: So, you care more about new customers than me?
14:45Michelle W.: That rate was good until 4/1/2013.
14:46me: I have been a member for 22 months. the price, for 22 months, at 50 mb, is what?
14:46me: 54.99
14:46me: yes or no?
14:47Michelle W.: I have it was $59.99 + modem rental of $5.00
14:47me: I'm not interested in that. look at your plan right now. on your own website, and tell me the price
14:48Michelle W.: The current 2013 new customer pricing is $54.99 with Modem rental.
14:48me: your charging me 93
14:48me: see a difference?
14:49me: I don't care, about new customers. I have been with you 22 months
14:49Michelle W.: When you upgraded the package it was only good until 4/1/2013. After that was over the account goes to full retail.
14:49me: I was not informed of that
14:49me: So, RCN's official stand is that you are fine screwing me over?
14:50me: they told me, when I upgraded, that my price was in line with what the website says
14:50me: So you are fine screwing me over?
14:50Michelle W.: Regular retail rates to apply all discounts have ended.
14:50me: why?
14:50me: 22 months
14:50me: do you understand that
14:51Michelle W.: The rates are constantly changing.
14:51me: so you lied to me when I upgraded, and over charge me now
14:51Michelle W.: Every quarter the packages online change.
14:51me: does it cost you more to give me internet than someone who just signs on?
14:51me: no
14:51me: it does not
14:51me: so why do I have to pay more
14:51me: I should be refunded for the whole month
14:52Michelle W.: We do send a statement monthly either by email or mail that has the cost of what is being taken out of the account and for the dates of the services.
14:53Michelle W.: Did you not get your current statement?
14:53me: I'm still a 22 month customer, I should be on standard price
14:53me: don't give me excuses, I don't give a shit about what you are saying to me. As a business if you have an unhappy customer, you do what you can to fix it
14:53me: you don't make excuses
14:53me: you fix it
14:54Michelle W.: Are you looking to transfer services over to the new address?
14:54me: I don't know, after this, I don't think I want to be with you
14:54Michelle W.: I would be able to see about getting new customer pricing and having this current bill backdated?
14:54Michelle W.: *.
14:55me: How about, you get it back dated for me now. and then we will discuss on whether I keep you or not
14:56Michelle W.: May I have the address you currently moved to?
14:56me: no, look into getting it back dated for me now, then I will be willing to discuss with you further
14:56Michelle W.: I would only be able to backdate with a transfer of service.
14:56me: beyond that, I have nothing to say to you
14:56me: so, tell me
14:56me: is RCN ok with screwing me over
14:56me: don't give me a corporate line
14:56me: don't give me PC bullshit
14:57me: give me a straight answer
14:57me: is your company ok with overcharging and stealing money from me
14:57Michelle W.: I can not backdate the current statement as is. We send out notification. I do not think that we are pulling anything over on you.
14:57me: Why can you not back date it, if you could if I kept you?
14:57me: that's bullshit and you know it
14:58me: So, yes, RCN's official line, is that your fine with stealing money from me?
14:58Michelle W.: When it comes to backdating and getting the new customer package on I have to have it set up as a transfer of service to a new address. Without having the new address and placing the transfer, the system doesn't allow anything to be placed on the account.
14:59me: I am posting this entire chat and my bankstatement to Reddit, 4chan, and any other forum I can find, and making sure you lose business, if you do nothing to help me.
14:59Michelle W.: I am trying to help and get you a new package and help with the last statement.
15:00me: for 22 months, the price is 54.99. i have been paying 64.99. I am still under 24 months, and you are charging 93 dollars, you are stealing from me.
15:00me: I am not willing to get a transfer, as I am unwilling to trust you again
15:00Michelle W.: The price is not $54.99 for 22 months. The rate was only good for 12 months.
15:01me: bullshit
15:01me: check your website now
15:01Michelle W.: I am on the website.
15:01me: I was told that my rate would be in line with what the website said, when I switched over
15:01me: even then, it was never at 93 dollars
15:02me: It was 64.99 at 3 years when I signed up, and less than that for 2 years, and less for 1. When I upgraded, I was only with you for like 6 months
15:03me: Does RCN support Loyalty?
15:03Michelle W.: We did give you new customer pricing that was available at that time.
15:03me: then it should have been available for 3 years!!!
15:03me: you have a 3 year pricing assurance
15:03Michelle W.: From what is on there now and what was on there then are different, to what was offered last year.
15:04me: How does it go from 65 to 93
15:04Michelle W.: Currently, Yes we have the three year pricing assurance. When you upgraded that is not available. You were placed into a package that was available at that time.
15:04me: give me a detailed list of expenses. Even last year, if you gave me new customer price, as you assure me you have, you had a 3 year pricing assurance
15:05me: yes it was, not the same prices, but you absolutely had 3 year price assurance
15:05Michelle W.: You went to full retail as of 4/1/2013
15:05me: full retail is not a detailed list
15:05me: do you understand what I am asking of you, yes or now
15:05me: no*(
15:05Michelle W.: You were not placed in a three year pricing package.
15:05me: bullshit
15:05me: I absolutely was, you had a 3 year price plan.
15:05me: even back then
15:06Michelle W.: At this time I do not have a detailed list of expenses.
15:06Michelle W.: Would you like me to help with seeing if we can transfer your services and see if we can get the current statement backdated?
15:07me: No, because I don't trust your shitty business. I expect a credit for my entire month.
15:07me: WHy would i trust you with more service after stealing money from me?
15:07Michelle W.: I do apologize, a credit will not be placed on the account at this time.
15:07me: Do you have a boss? and can I talk to them please
15:08Michelle W.: We did sent out notification of the account charges before it was processed.
15:08me: If that's true, i never got it
15:08me: but i doubt the truth of such a statement
15:08me: Let me speak to your boss
15:08Michelle W.: They are not available at this time. They are out of the office. You can call us at 800-746-4726 and ask to speak with a Manager.
15:08me: they are out of the office at 3pm on a tuesday?
15:09Michelle W.: Correct! They are not in the office this week.
15:09me: wow, you guys have superb customer service.
15:10Michelle W.: Any additional questions I can help you with today?
15:10me: You can start with my 25 dollar credit that I was offered. That will almost cover my overdraft charge, that I received after being overcharged.
15:10me: Can I have your full name please, not just a w
15:11me: because I would like to know it, when talking to someone on the phone
15:11me: You have my last name, it's only fair
15:11Michelle W.: I will place the $25.00 Credit on the account for you that Max did offer. I can give you my employees ID number 021441. I am the only Michelle W.
15:12me: Also, I hope RCN looks forward to this conversation being posted on Reddit, Digg, 4chan, and other various internet forums
15:13Michelle W.: I have also posted the chat in your account so when you do call anyone can reference it.
15:13Michelle W.: The credit is now applied to the account. Your next statement will so a one time credit of $25.00.

2267,Help DARPA develop software to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Big Data Analytic Applications,"The DARPA XDATA program is pioneering a new model of agile software development to support analysts working with big data. XDATA is developing a number of cutting edge software applications and components to address timely challenges in data science and intelligence analysis. DARPA has made these applications free and open to the public available as a downloadable [open catalog](http://opencatalog.darpa.mil/XDATA.html) of reconfigurable, open-source software components. XDATA is inviting analysts from the defense and intelligence communities, law enforcement, the private sector, and the public at large to download and use these open-source applications and underlying code. Building a community around the XDATA software catalog can help shape future versions of these applications through use and feedback. The applications developed by XDATA in 2015 address the following challenge problems:

1. Mapping, predicting, and characterizing population movements within and between cities and regions

2. Cross-dataset dealiasing to identify the same entities across different datasets

3. Financial event detection, such as identifying evidence of market manipulation 

**Operation XDATA: A Public Event**
Through this site you can also learn how to volunteer to participate in Operation XDATA, which is a large-scale research program managed by Draper. This research is designed to evaluate and improve XDATA applications. As part of this research you will be able to use XDATA application with large data sets to complete challenging tasks. After using these applications, you can download them and their underlying code for your own purposes. More information about testing can be found below in our formal call for research participants. You can also find this information on our study portal (click “Register”) at [http://xdataonline.com/](http://xdataonline.com/).

**Call for Research Participants**

The purpose of this study is to determine whether certain kinds of interfaces and analytic tools affect your analytic workflow. This study is funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Your participation will include providing information about your basic demographics, personality, analytic abilities via online questionnaire. This will be followed by a testing session to be completed at your convenience through our online testing portal. During the testing session, you will be asked to participate in a variety of tasks, questionnaires and cognitive tests, as well as interactive tasks on a computer. 

**Eligibility Information**

Participation in this research is open to any persons between the ages of 18 and 60 years, that are not incarcerated (i.e., prisoners) or a member of another legally protected population (i.e., intellectually handicapped, children, etc.), with the exception of pregnant women (the procedures and materials used in this study do not limit the participation of pregnant women). You may be excluded from participation if you do not have sufficient formal training or experience in interpretation of data, hypothesis testing, or construction of reasoned argument to effectively answer questions about analytic process or participate in laboratory tasks. Ideally, potential participants have at least 3 years applied or working experience within an analytic vocation (e.g., intelligence, military, legal, business, marketing, credit, banking, finance, and capital markets, etc.), OR post-graduate training within a relevant area of study and associated analytic skills (e.g., economics, behavioral sciences, statistics, political science, etc.), OR have had relevant internships, post-doctoral, or research experience. However, should you feel that you meet the requirements given your applied experience, we will consider eligibility on a case-by-case basis. 
 
**Additional Study Details**

Study Duration:  Your participation in this study can involve up to 3 hours of your time: approximately 30-60 minutes to fill out online questionnaires, and 90-120 minutes as you engage in online analytic tasks. Additional follow-up tasks with similar content may be solicited, with your permission. Each of these are estimated to take between 90-120 minutes.

*Participant Involvement*:  Participation involves both completion of the online questionnaires and online tasks, which involve using next generation analytic tools to solve difficult analytic problems using complex data sources. However, participation in the online questionnaires neither obligates you to participate in online analytic tasks nor guarantees that you will be invited for follow up tasks.
 
*Compensation*:  Participation is strictly voluntary—there is no monetary compensation for participation in this study. However, participants being recruited from university research sites may be eligible for course/research credit commensurate with their participation as per their institution’s guidelines.

Looking at Japanese train stations and financial infrastructure—even their *toilet seats*, for goodness sake—makes me wonder where we went wrong, how we fell so far behind.  Are the 1% to blame for hoarding the wealth, or is it our willingness to settle for less as a whole??

Let me introduce myself I am Jake, I am 22 years old and I have a very very firm stance that VR and AR are the future and will most likely be bigger than Amazon in terms of market capitalization of industries. How can one technology do this? Well it's quite simply because just like the internet in it's early stages, there is not a single industry that CAN'T benefit from these technologies. Medical (practice of surgeries, medicine simulations, training, etc), construction (virtual walkthrough of designs, trainings, and more), military, fire, police, and EMTs (all benefit from this in training purposes), movie (live up close put yourself in the movie experiences), music (virtual concerts and up close studio experiences), sports (field side seats see all the action up close, possibly even views based off of players wearing cameras), gaming (one of the most current uses of VR), social media (vr coffee shops, bonfires, social gathering rooms, social events), event industry (virtual car show walk throughs, and other event show walk throughs), car industry (this one could go hand in hand with gaming but virtual test drives, virtual look around inside and outside of the car, VR assembly experience). So as you can see I can go on and on and on but I ran out of characters lol. VR would and should capitalize on trainings, up close and personal experiences, virtual walk throughs, and more!

2626,What phone line?,"Hello Everyone.

So this was back in the late 90s when dialup was still a thing . . . and Covid-19 wasn’t!

I was a trainer in the health care industry and would travel to various facilities to install a new records management system developed by SoftwareCo that would replace paper-based patient care information.  In addition to installing and testing the system, the server and the workstations, I would train their care and admin staff on the software.  We also offered a one-day session for the admin staff on the last day that we were onsite on how to use e-mail, and how to use a web browser (yes, you read that correctly - we were training them how to surf the web!)

As part of the pre-work, we would send a list of requirements to the facility (e.g. 4 workstations with xxx processor, yyy RAM, dedicated phone line, etc.)  They needed the phone line because:

a) they were required to transmit daily statistical data to a central government agency and

b) to provide us access for remote software support.  

It was up to the facility to source the hardware as we were strictly a software shop.  The first step for me when starting at a new install was to meet with the person running the facility, we’ll call this person Administrator, and the care director to review the agenda for the coming week, and to inspect all of the equipment to ensure it was to spec and functional.

So, enough back story.  I arrive at RealSuper Care Facility bright and early Monday morning to meet with Administrator and go over the plan.  My first inkling that things might not go smoothly were the dozen or so completion certificates he had proudly displayed on his office wall for various computer courses he had taken.  I don’t remember what the couses were exactly, but they were ALL along the lines of “Using the Mouse, Level 2” or “floppy disk use and storage” - something that pretty much anyone else would be embarrassed to display in public.  Hmm .... okaaayyy.  We discussed the schedule for the upcoming week and that part seemed ok, the training room was ready to go, yes there was the phone jack for internet, the equipment was all up to spec (barely!). Ok, good to go!

So the week starts and I quickly realize that the administrator has cheaped out and bought the most bargain-basement crap he could find.  Every day of training at least two machines wouldn’t be working, so the trainees were doubling up so we could get the training done.  I would stay every night until at least 10:00 pm trying to get the lame computers working.  Did I say this happened every day?  I should state that I was 90% trainer and 10% tech support, so probably could have sorted things out faster if I had been more knowledgeable on the hardware side, but in my defence the whiz kids back at company HQ that I was calling for help couldn’t figure it out any faster either.  

Well, we had some good laughs in the training sessions, the care staff started feeling more comfortable with the concept that paper was going away, and the computers were slowly getting less buggy.  So, finish up the last day of training on our product, time to prep for tomorrow’s interweb? umm, Webnet? er, Internet? training session.  

Ok, Netscape browser is installed (remember Netscape?) good, email is installed, great, let’s check the dialup connection.  Hmm, not working.  Fiddle with the modem settings .... nope, still not working.  *scratches head*  Ok, let’s try plugging a landline phone into the jack ... hmm ... no dial tone.  That’s weird.  I caught Administrator just as he was about to leave for the day and explained the issue and asked if he had the contact info for the technician who installed the line.  I mean, maybe there was some step that didn’t get finalized for some reason?  Hopefully something quick and easy?

So I got the tech on the phone, and explained the situation.  Man, did he ever laugh!  He said “Yep, I installed the plug, but there is no phone line connected to it”.  

You know that weird dissociative feeling you get as you realize that you have slipped into the twilight zone?  That was me at that moment.  It was such a bizarre thing for him to have said that I wanted to make sure that I completely understood what I was hearing.  

Me:  “Umm, so you installed a phone jack in the wall, but there is nothing connected to it?”

Technician:  “Yep”

Me:  ... long pause ... “Umm, why?”

Turns out the phone tech dude had a long, frustrating conversation with Administrator, where Administrator couldn’t be convinced that when the spec sheet said to install a phone connection that it would need a jack AND a phone line and phone number.  So, the tech finally gave up and just cut a hole in the wall and slapped a phone jack in place.  I saw the work order afterwards - he charged $125 for the service call!  Hmm, maybe if I looked in r/maliciouscompliance I’ll find his side of the story?

Well, I was able to “borrow” their fax line for the next day and delivered the training.  It was bad.  Administrator would look at a website and, when I led them through various steps, he would write down exactly the steps we followed.  I’m thinking “dude, they change things around on websites all the time you know.  I am trying to teach concepts, not steps to follow by rote”.  

... But I kept that to myself.

Some of the other staff were getting a great kick out of finding sites about “corn” .... “um, that’s not a great idea on work computers” (Facepalm)

So I finished the training, set everything up and tested it all.  Success!  Aaaand I’m outta here.

I am no longer with SoftwareCo, but I kept in touch and heard that this facility continued to be a nightmare.  

Maybe it would’ve gone more smoothly if we had given Administrator a competition certificate? ;)

So that’s my (long) story.  I hope you enjoyed it!

Hi r/tech ! We are a team of students in general management in Switzerland and for the last year of our master we work in relationship with a center of microtechnics and electrotechnics that developed a technology and we must find applications for it. But to do that we first want to know what people even expect from it!  I know this sounds like self-promotion but I won't be giving away the company name nor any contact info (and this Reddit account is my personal), what we really want are your opinions.

  

But first a presentation of said device:

--------------

Our device is a sensor that measures and monitors different factors such as air quality, temperature, humidity, light and it can also use a camera to take pictures. The device is plugged on a flexible photovoltaic cell (PV cell) that can also generate power in non-direct sunlight (inside a room, house, ...). The PV cell is built as a sticker so you can basically stick it wherever you want. The device works in ultra-low-power (ULP) and communicates the data through Bluetooth LE. 

Photo of our sensor: https://i.imgur.com/93joHc8.png

We can integrate different captors (visual, sound, infra-red, chemical) it holds a battery, a memory chip and a small processor that can support an already trained IA or another basic program.

The consumer buys the number of “PV stickers and sensors” that they needs. They can use one by room to monitor their interior. Then the data can be sent (encrypted or not) to their phone / computer or monitoring device. Our goal there is to save energy and its costs by monitoring your interior simply and efficiently.

Since the device can support an already trained IA we wanted to make it open source so that any customer can create their own program and share it with the community. Which is where you might be interested?

--------------------------------------

2646,Impact & Understanding of (Nvidia’s) Denoiser on the Movie Industry,"Hey Reddit,

I recently saw a few article about Denoisers (-> e.g Nvidia Denoiser in OptiX, or the V-Ray Denoiser [1], [2], [3]), and I am super impressed by the technology and would love to learn more about it.

I am especially interested in where it can be applied, which devices you need for it, and its impact on the film industry. For instance, does drastically reduced render-times mean **we can expect shorter time-periods between high-quality movies?** 😃

Would be cool if you could help me in my search for answers. Plus, please be a little forgiving, I’m not too deep into the technical material :S   (just some dude who is generally impressed by it)


Here are my thoughts: 

1. Is the Denoiser ‘only’ good enough for previews (-> fast work iterations), or is it also used in the final render pass of the movie? (which output we see in the cinema)

2. If it would be good enough for the final pass, does that imply the movie industry can produce their animated films much faster now? And thus, we should expect more animated movies coming out soon? (looking at you @ Pixar 😃)

3. Do we need a GPU do use the Denoiser, or does it work with CPUs as well? I suspect it is neural-network inference, and thus should work on both devices? (if not: please provide some details)

4. Does the Denoiser work on ‘all’ render scenes that use path tracing ( ray tracing and/or radiance)? Moreover, which segments does this include? (Animation movies? Action film? GCI? Cartoons? Anime?) 

5. Do all modern render-engines have their own Denoiser? If so: Which one would you say is currently the state-of-the-art? 


Thanks a lot !

2649,With great power comes great responsibility – but will tech companies accept it?,"In *The Amazing Spider-*Man, a young Peter Parker is coming to grips with his newly-acquired powers. Spider-Man in nature but not in name, he suddenly finds himself with increased reflexes, strength and extremely sticky hands. 

Unfortunately, the subway isn’t the controlled environment for Parker to awaken as a sudden superhuman. His hands stick to a woman’s shoulders and he’s unable to move them. His powers are doing exactly what they were designed to do, with creepy, unsettling effects.

Spider-Man’s powers aren’t amazing yet; they’re poorly understood, disturbing and dangerous. As other commuters move to the woman’s defence, shoving Parker away from the woman, his sticky hands inadvertently rip the woman’s top clean off. Now his powers are invading people’s privacy.

A fully-fledged assault follows, but Parker’s Spider-Man reflexes kick in. He beats his assailants off, sending them careening into subway seats and knocking them unconscious, apologising the whole time. 

Parker’s unintended creepiness, apologetic harmfulness and head-spinning bewilderment at his own power is a useful metaphor to think about another set of influential nerds: the technological geniuses building the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’.  


Sudden power, the inability to exercise it responsibly, collateral damage and a need for restraint – it all sounds pretty familiar when we think about ‘killer robots’, mass data collection tools and genetic engineering.   


This is troubling, because we need tech designers to, like Spider-Man, recognise (borrowing from Voltaire) that “with great power comes great responsibility”. And unfortunately, it’s going to take more than a comic book training sequence for us to figure this out. [http://www.ethics.org.au/on-ethics/blog/november-2018/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-–-but](http://www.ethics.org.au/on-ethics/blog/november-2018/with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility-–-but)",a1dy72,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/a1dy72/with_great_power_comes_great_responsibility_but/
2650,Help DARPA develop software to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Big Data Analytic Applications,"The DARPA XDATA program is pioneering a new model of agile software development to support analysts working with big data. XDATA is developing a number of cutting edge software applications and components to address timely challenges in data science and intelligence analysis. DARPA has made these applications free and open to the public available as a downloadable [open catalog](http://opencatalog.darpa.mil/XDATA.html) of reconfigurable, open-source software components. XDATA is inviting analysts from the defense and intelligence communities, law enforcement, the private sector, and the public at large to download and use these open-source applications and underlying code. Building a community around the XDATA software catalog can help shape future versions of these applications through use and feedback. The applications developed by XDATA in 2015 address the following challenge problems:

1. Mapping, predicting, and characterizing population movements within and between cities and regions

2. Cross-dataset dealiasing to identify the same entities across different datasets

3. Financial event detection, such as identifying evidence of market manipulation 

**Operation XDATA: A Public Event**
Through this site you can also learn how to volunteer to participate in Operation XDATA, which is a large-scale research program managed by Draper. This research is designed to evaluate and improve XDATA applications. As part of this research you will be able to use XDATA application with large data sets to complete challenging tasks. After using these applications, you can download them and their underlying code for your own purposes. More information about testing can be found below in our formal call for research participants.

2651,A short history of technology,"Our best technologies and developments were created before 1913 and the centralization of government power behind guise of Federal Reserve and IRS (16th amendment).  When you look at the remarkable accomplishments of America in the 19th century as opposed to the 20th century, you see how staggeringly different we have become from that hundred years of progress before 1913.  Just a few of the outstanding innovations that were discovered:

-	Railroads & trains (moved goods like never before)
-	Steamships (ditto)
-	Electricity!
-	Lightbulbs
-	Toilets
-	Indoor plumbing
-	Automobiles
-	Airplanes
-	Automatic machine gun
-	Gun silencer (1909) 
-	Refrigerator for home use (1913)
-	Telephone (1876)
-	Tractor (1892)

And what have we accomplished in the hundred years since 1913 that matches the remarkable nature of the previous century of innovations?  

-	Tanks
-	Nuclear bomb / hydrogen bomb
-	Microwave  (from research into weaponry)
-	Taser
-	High energy laser weapons
-	Spaceship (to get us to the moon before the Russians)
-	The Internet (were it not for its founders to open source the Internet, we might never know about it as it existed as a Department of Defense project under DARPA)
-	Mobile phones

The great innovations since 1913 are results of the military industrial complex research and development operations.  This does not bode well for the freedoms ahead of us in the 21st century as we look at our inability to cure diseases for the past 30 years (cancer, AIDS).  We can harness the power of the atom but we can't cure cancer?   

It is clear that our nation operates under the power of a wealthy circle intimately connected to the strings of debt created by the Federal Reserve.  We cannot invest in new technologies as the power to fund new research and development is in the hands of few.  Please comment and share.

2656,About H1-B Programmers and Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Companies - my experience,"I have been a frequent reader of this sub, and I always found it fascinating to read stories and discussions on H1-B program or H1-B programmers here. Having been on the other side of this story, I found some of it to be truthful, some wrong, some dishonest, and most of it to be stereotypical. In most cases, the participation has always been one sided, so I thought I should share my point of view. This is not an effort to convince anyone of anything - this is about what I experienced as an H1-B migrant. Yes, I will try to make some points on what I believe to be misconceptions, but I am not writing this in defense of anything.

This may become a long post - apologies in advance if it's not your style.

----------------------

A little bit on my H1-B journey: I am from India. I hold Bachelor of Engineering (undergrad) degree - but not in Computer Science. Right after my undergrad, I was picked up by one of those 'famous' Indian giant companies to be a software engineer. I was trained for 3 months in some very basic subjects of C, Unix, Databases etc. Then we did some mock projects mocking a real system and eventually started working on a real but small project where real learnings happened. I was fortunate to work with some really bright computer engineers/programmers and learned a lot that helps me even today. Eventually, I made it to the USA on H1-B program. Since then, I have been in this country for more than 10 years, have become US citizen, have a great family and a nice job. I love technology in general and programming in particular. I travel around the country whenever I get a chance. It's been good so far.

----------------------

Here is my take on things I have read here or somewhere else on the contentious subject of H1-B:

## On The Giant Evil Indian Outsourcing Company:
Companies such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS are not just supplying bodies to the Evil American Corporation. They take up small/big projects (may be maintenance or support project, or may be a bigger product/feature/website development project). They have some people on-site, but many more people offshore working on programming/development/coding/testing.
At the same time, in a lot of cases, they could provide people to work on a client site merely as another software engineer for the client. But that’s not what makes them money, and they don’t really prefer doing it.

Most of their clients are medium to large to enterprise companies. There are some technology companies too, but big retail chains, big new york banks etc are more typical clients.
They recruit freshers in big numbers. Train them for a short time in basics of programming and then are allocated to work on real projects. For a while, they perform less important/less critical tasks. But the real education do happen on these projects. They eventually become good enough to start being productive. (Those without any competence are either let go, or - if they somehow manage to wing it for a year or two - will become managers. Yes.)

These places are not easy to work at. A lot of competition. Typical rat race. To move up the ladder, you have to be a very good programmer (and a very good talker) or have a very good godfather manager to take care of you. In most cases, people don’t want to be a better programmer or learn new technologies or want to continue on technical stream. They want to become manager (project manager, product manager, bullshit manager, real manager - whatever). I think this happens because most of the employees are not naturally good at programming. They just happen to be in IT because that’s what pays.

Having said that, a really good techie can make a very successful career, if he/she is equally good at selling himself/herself. At the same time, a good programmer who isn’t good at selling himself can go through the process hell where nobody gives shit about his talents and loses creativity, passion and love for technology. Really good ones will know this early on and move out to a real technology company.

These companies have processes in place. A lot of it actually. There are a billion documents to prepare, a million of audits to go through, and a thousand standards to be certified with. While having some processes in place is a good thing, these places are nightmares for those who want to just program. They process the shit out of everybody and everything.

These companies do have some good programmers working for them. I have worked with some truly talented people. They understand tenets, nuances and principles of programming/software engineering and use it brilliantly. They are as good as a good programmer you may find in the US or anywhere. But they are not the norm. Most of the programmers are average. They follow the orders, churn out code as per requirements. They just want to get their paychecks, move up the ladder as fast as they can so they don’t have to code anymore.


## On Salaries and Doing Things Illegally:

These companies, contrary to popular belief, do not really try anything illegal.
In the past, they might have bent the rules like sending somebody onsite to do real work on business visa (a strict no-no), but those were exceptions then and almost never happen nowadays.

They do not pay that badly. Yes, they are not going to be paying top money, but their salaries are dictated by the laws where they can’t really exploit their employees. E.g. Around 10 years back, say a guy with 4-6 years of experience in software development might have been paid 70-80k salary working in, say, north-east region.

They do not take away anyone’s passport. Never. (This actually happens a lot with those small companies who basically promise H1-B to a lot of unfortunate graduates in India for a hefty commission, and almost everything they do is illegal, but this is definitely not true for big established companies like Infosys, TCS, CTS etc.)

They can’t and don’t prevent people from leaving and switching their employers. They try to retain such people, but not illegally - like taking their passports away or threatening them.

## On Going Onsite (or Nirvana!):

Once you win H1-B lottery, the company will try ASAP to place you on-site in the states. That’s because there is a limited number of people with this visa, and there is a huge demand for them to be on-site - as project coordinators, as client-site development/maintenance/support team member, or in some cases purely to add another person to client development team.
Also this is a wet dream of any Indian programmer working for these companies. The Purpose of Life. The Ultimate Goal. Nirvana. Whatever you call it.

They will board a flight, find other coworkers already settled at the destination city, arrange for a short term accommodation with them or with their help. In most cases, these companies have large number of people already onsite. So for a newcomer, it’s easy to settle in. In cases where the client is in the town of Bumblefuck and there is nobody there they know, people will still figure things out and be the torchbearer for next set of incoming people. Indians are crafty enough to figure things out.

For most people, they have two end goals for their Trip to the USA - either settle here for good, or make enough money to buy a very expensive apartment in Bangalore. So they wish for a long term project. Some people are sent only for short terms, but they too return back eventually for long term.

Few of them struggle and find difficult to adjust to new country, new culture and new people - but most of them are flexible enough to be able to continue living for long time.
These companies are reluctant to file for green-cards because it's expensive to do so, but they do it for a minority of H1-B employees. If you have a good clout or a friendly manager, are good at talking, or are critical to a project, companies most likely will do it for you, but it’s not easy.

Those who are still not married or are traveling without family share accommodations - this maximizes their savings, and they don’t mind sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with three other people. India is a country of a lot of people, and we are used to be around lot of people. Granted, some of these apartments are small and crowded, but most of these people have absolutely no problem with it.

A lof of H1-B migrants do not mix well with local people, or culture. They will form their own groups within and without the office space. If there are large number of other people from their mother company at client site, they will stick to each other, go for lunches together in big groups. If and when they become comfortable at client site, they will also start behaving with more freedom and less professionally - which means talking and laughing loudly in their groups, speaking in their mother-tongues etc. They will stick to eating Indian food most/all the time. Most of them are not adventurous enough to try new cuisine. Well, other than Dominoe's. They stick to watching Indian movies. Of course they will also watch Hollywood blockbusters, but they don’t explore anything other than mainstream movies. They have absolutely no idea about local music pubs, arts or museums.
They like big breaks for tea/coffee and spend time on silly talks. That’s because a lot of them have no family and have no life outside work.
They spend hours at office. Even after they go home, they will have calls with offshore teams that can last until midnight.
Did I mention most of them have no life outside work? They don’t.
Some people are good at programming and technology, and they will stand out among other average people. If they are adventurous enough, they will get a decent job (since H1-B allows people to switch jobs). But most of them never consider that option because they have average programming skills.

## My own experience as H1-B programmer:
My first project was for a big bank, where I started on the project at off-shore, in India, and was eventually sent onsite when I had my H1-B.

It was a charged environment where there was already a lot of anger against people like me among the programmers and other employees at the client company. I didn’t know any of that, until I started noticing odd behaviors of people. (Note: People on H1 visa at the client site are almost always treated as second class citizens - partially because they don’t try to mix well with local employees, partially because of a huge cultural divide, but mainly because they are a threat to local employment. Even when there isn't any loss of jobs with local employees, they are always suspicious. I don’t find this surprising, but it’s not a good experience for any of the two parties.)

I moved onto a different client, different team, had a much pleasant experience, was welcome to the client team, but always worked on shitty projects. I did my best in whatever work I did, impressed my colleagues and client managers and kept at it - until I got a green-card (not through my employer, but with a different route of family sponsorship).

I quit as soon as I could, found a much better job with more challenging and satisfying work, and haven’t looked back since.

I consider myself a very good programmer, have loved doing what I do and would wnat to continue doing it for as long as I can. My job pays well, I have traveled a lot, have made many friends from all parts of life, and have settled in well.

I find this country and people to be very friendly, very accommodating and fun. There are a thousand things to do outside work, and I engage in a lot of them.

I can go on, but I think this should give some idea of life of H1-B programmers and the Evil Indian Companies who send them here.

I can answer questions if people are interested. I will stick to what I know as objectively as possible, but in the end, they are just my opinions and my experience.

-----------------

*TLDR*: Big Indian Outsourcing Tech Companies are not as evil as they are made out to be. A typical H1-B programmer from India is most likely average at his/her work. Some are really good at their work. I was one of these programmers. I have done pretty well overall - have settled down here for good and love being a programmer working with cool people.

2711,"Suggestion for phone reviewers: When reviewing charging speed, please also review screen-on charging speed. It is equally as important.","Originally posted [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/hrph53/suggestion_for_phone_reviewers_when_reviewing/), but deleted from there. Apparently, this Subreddit is more suitable.

----
When watching phone reviews online (YouTubers and tech magazines), I have noticed that most tech reviewers **only measure the charging speed while the screen is turned off!** 

But a **historical weakness** of many *fast charging* phones is that the charging speed is **severely throttled** while the device is in use. Fast charging thus only works when the device is in stand-by mode or powered off, which means that **one can not use the device and charge fast at the same time.** Screen-on charging speed is equally as important, because not being able to up the battery quickly while using the device at the same time is very, very inconvenient.

I have done measurements with several historical Samsung flagship devices such as Note 5, S6, S7, S8, Note 8 and Note 9, and noticed that the charging speed is close to 15 watts (as supposed) with screen off but **miserable 6 watts total with screen on**, which would have definitely been a relevant point for tech reviewers to address.

Whether there is a good technical reason or not for mobile phone manufacturers to add such a restriction, e.g. heat, **it should still be addressed in mobile phone reviews.**

----

I hope that mobile phone reviewers who read this are going to address this important point in future reviews.",hrptro,0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/hrptro/suggestion_for_phone_reviewers_when_reviewing/

Pretty much like this comic says http://xkcd.com/612/ Well, first of all what kind of speed I am actually getting here, is it the average of the three, could it even be combination of the three.

2890,Wifi signal issues,"Hi everyone, I hope I'm posting in a relevant subreddit. 

I recently changed my internet package, and was given a new wireless router, which is now in a new position. It used to be in the first floor, but is now on the second floor near the kitchen. Before the switch, I would get perfect reception everywhere in the house. But now, even though the wifi status bar will show full strength, the download speeds are dramatically reduced if I'm in certain parts of the house. In an upstairs bedroom, I'll be lucky to get 1mbps and will sometimes have no connection at all. The download speeds are supposed to be 15mbps, and when my laptop is near the router, the speeds are near 14. Also, in certain other parts of the house, I'll have wild differences in the download speed each time I run the test. The upload speeds don't seem to be affected much by this. 

I tried changing the channel, but that wouldn't make any difference. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",xzisu,3,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/xzisu/wifi_signal_issues/

I was just wondering what happens in the US, if you are sick of Comcast or Time Warner Cable is there actual no other option, is the other option so bad its not worth even trying it or are the ISPs so connected with one another they won't try to compete?

Three years ago, u/crispy88 and I started to work on a way to enable the smartphones we all carry around everyday to communicate even when central connectivity is unreliable or unavailable — turns out that required external hardware... the idea turned into [goTenna](http://gotenna.com).

It's a little device that pairs wirelessly with your smartphone and enables you to text & share locations on offline maps even when you don't have cell service or wifi. You can communicate with others who have goTenna up to several miles away. Some early users have gotten up to 5 miles in the outdoors with altitude; in urban areas it's more like up to 1 mile. [See some photos & videos here.](http://www.gotenna.com/pages/stories)

To celebrate our launch and thank the mods for hosting us, we're offering all members of this sub $10 off any order through 11:59 pm EST on Wednesday! (Just use discount code **R/TECH** [at checkout](http://www.gotenna.com/products/buy-gotenna).)

3516,USA-China new digital Cold War?,". Huawei, among other items, makes a key product called radio access networks, (or RANs) the part of a telecommunications system that connects phones to telco networks through radio connections including base stations, antennas, chips and controllers. Besides Huawei, the RAN business, (which is about $76 billion in annual sales,) is dominated by Samsung (Korean), Ericsson (Swedish), Nokia (Finnish) and ZTE (also Chinese and also at loggerheads with the U.S. government.)

The Trump administration at first began telling allies in Europe that buying Huawei technology posed a national security risk, though with no hard evidence. That gained little traction. “The message was ‘trust us,’ but that is not a strong suit from this administration,” says an industry source. But what if the argument was framed in terms of economics, this source continued. If Huawei and ZTE gain more and more market share then the non-Chinese suppliers, which like all companies in the sectors need to spend billions of dollars of capital .
Trump’s early approach was to bully and threaten U.S. allies like Germany and the UK to abandon Huawei.   It didn’t quite work. And when the Trump administration has blocked the export of U.S. tech to China, the Chinese have responded maybe not the way Trump anticipated. “Rather than confront any U.S. restrictions, what they’ve basically done is make stronger efforts to try to reduce reliance on imported technologies, particularly U.S. ones. That seems to be part of the broader multi-year strategy that they’re implementing,” says Bruce Kasman, chief economist and managing director of global research at JPMorgan Chase.
And the Trump administration has moved to ban TikTok, which now has 80 million-plus monthly active users in the U.S. A key bone of contention here: Money, money, money. that,      this is a rivalry which will define societies; education, culture, the military,     and in the end personal freedom and responsibility.",juejmd,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/juejmd/usachina_new_digital_cold_war/

3585,China is making a huge mistake by letting Huawei fight alone,"[https://www.scmp.com/tech/gear/article/3036800/huawei-defies-odds-lead-global-telecoms-market-after-180-days-us-trade](https://www.scmp.com/tech/gear/article/3036800/huawei-defies-odds-lead-global-telecoms-market-after-180-days-us-trade)

I read this article today and it made me sad how much effort Huawei is making just to stay alive as a company. The Huawei case has shown China is in an emergency situation that is as dire as not having a nuke while a Nuclear power is threatening.

US can destroy China's phone companies overseas business anytime by just switching off Google. Its not just appstore. Most Android apps rely on Google Play services. Chinese companies will be doomed without it.

US can force Taiwan or other companies to cutoff supplies to any Chinese company by threatening to put them into entity list. Again, this means even Samsung or TSMC might stop selling their chips. That will destroy these companies even at home.All Chinese phone, Laptop or any type electronics companies are under huge threat.

Huawei is trying to develop alternatives to Google services such as Maps library and Huawei Core to replace Google Play services. But can such effort be successful if Huawei is the only one using it?

Huawei will not be that successful when other chinese companies still use google apps and services. It will create unfair disadvantage for Huawei since most app makers will not have the incentive to support them when its only Huawei having a different platform. This is the same problem Windows phone faced and ultimately failed. And these other chinese companies like Xiaomi will not take the tough decision and sacrifices needed to get rid of US dependence as long as they are not also banned.

Can Huawei designed instruction set be successful if Xiaomi still uses ARM? No, sadly. it will be losing business massively.

Huawei laptop business is over due to Windows ban. Can a Huawei developed laptop with a different OS be ever successful even in China, when every other Chinese company makes laptop with windows? 

There should be a combined effort among these companies to create one common system used by all chinese companies. There should be a few powerful system companies for things like Chip instruction set, Operating sytem and Phone App store instead of the current separate effort by everyone at the same time that ultimately will fail due to fragmentation.

Chinese govt should make this effort to force these companies to make sacrifices now. There should be a requirement of using atleast 30% or whatever percentage of phones or laptops that must be released with a chinese made OS or chip or app store.  There should be effort to create companies for systems where all these phone or electronic companies will have joint ownership.

Companies will only focus on short term gains and ultimately lose. China must make effort to create a long term safety.

Huawei should not fight alone. Xiaomi and Oppo and others should help and create one Chinese alternative end-to-end system instead of fighting among each other.",dt7phx,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/dt7phx/china_is_making_a_huge_mistake_by_letting_huawei/

3836,"Which company will fall first: Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, or Microsoft?"," The first could be either Google or Facebook.

**Google** and **Facebook** are extremely reliant on data and control a sizable chunk of our personal data. And they both are incredibly valuable without which many of us cannot imagine our lives. Their survival would be in threat precisely because they deal with an extremely important resource.

Given the importance of the data and how governments are elected/toppled with it, there will be increasing regulations in the next few years. The data is too important for its power to be ignored by the corridors of power. Think of what happened to them in China. What if other governments also treat them that way?

A few decades ago people could not imagine the world without **AT&T**. They controlled all the communication in the USA. Their technology was so valuable and their hold on the market so big, that they were eventually broken up into baby bells. AT&T never regained its pole position in technology.

That could happen to **Google** or **Facebook**. At some point regulations could come out to make the data a shared resource that all companies could use. And increasing regulations on how this data is used.

They might not go completely out of business, but might not be in the same pole position as they do today.

Compared to Google and Facebook, what **Microsoft** and **Apple** produces are fairly less important to the society. You can easily live without an **iPhone** or **Azure**. Thus, there will be lesser regulatory pressure on them.

That said, Apple being in the fashion business will find it hard to keep making devices that people like. Two or three bad models in a row could put Apple out of the market \[*the company itself might survive with the cash and reinvent to do something else*\]. This is what happened to Nokia - they dominated the phone market and then disappeared from the market.

Microsoft is a tough nut to crack. It survived the US government trying hard to break it. It survives the great firewall of China - something other US companies have not been able to. It survived a concrete attack by almost everyone else in the tech business. It survived Steve Ballmer. It creates something important, but not too important.

That said, **Amazon** might be the hardest to dislodge as theirs involve building a large logistics chain that is going to be needed for a long time.

My bet is:

Personally, i still have a 3 year ""old"" LG G3, with a custom rom, that i use on a daily basis and even that is more than enough for my needs. At some point there has to be a justified benefit of spending hundreds of dollars on the latest and greatest, and how much of that investment we actually get to utilize. How much do we really need to swipe more smoothly, surf the web faster, text/email, play games or to take super res pictures and video for the everyday user? I wanted to start a discussion to see if people indeed buy the latest and greatest or hang on to older phones that meet their needs.

4006,The new iPhones are boring,"I remember about 6-7 years ago, when we had the iPhone 4S. The iPhone 5 seemed revolutionary with its new 4” screen. The next year, the 5S seemed revolutionary with its new Touch ID sensor (the 5C not so much). Then we got the 6, with an actually needed improvement, the 4.7” and 5.5” screen sizes. Fast forward three years, we got the X (the 6S, 7, and 8 are all slightly upgraded versions of the 6 to me, nothing revolutionary). Ever since the X, none of the new iPhone releases (XS, Xr, 11, 11 Pro...) amaze me anymore. I don’t really care about the fact that the processor is 30% faster, nor do I care that the cameras are 50% better or that there are 3 cameras now. Where has Apple gone, and will it ever reach the fame they had during 2012-2014?

4174,Announcement to let you know about two new updates to the subreddit,"Hey /r/tech, 

Welcome, new subscribers. We appreciate the fact that you're here. We come to you today with two significant updates to the subreddit.

---

First, and probably the most noticeable is the added list of related subreddits that we've added to the top of the subreddit. We intend for this subreddit to serve as a hub or jumping off point for people interested in technology and this list will serve to funnel them into smaller and more narrow subreddits that cater to more specific interests. I'd like to give /u/hero0fwar a public shout out for helping us with our CSS.

I'm sure many of you are wondering why your favorite gaming and science related subreddits are not included, and the reason for this is that there are gaming and science related defaults and these defaults should (and do) link to more narrow subreddits and already serve this purpose. 

We're also limited to how many categories that we have. Any more than around 6 (what we have now) and it starts to become unreadable at lower horizontal resolutions.

We also have a hard limit on the number of actual characters that we can fit in our sidebar. 

[So we created this exhaustive list](http://www.reddit.com/r/tech/wiki/related). Shout out to /u/CustardFilled from the /r/buildapc IRC for putting together the list. This list is also included in the general category under ""more...""

This list should be editable by anyone with 50 karma in the subreddit. Please keep the list nicely organized and formatted if you'd like to make changes. If you do mess something up, however, don't worry. It can always be reverted. Just send us a quick modmail if you don't know how to do it yourself. 

--- 

The second thing that we wanted to talk about is that we've tapped /u/TheGreatInquisitor to handle our **weekly** tech politics recap thread. He seems like a quality guy and although I suspect we're all unathletic nerds here we can at least appreciate a well run subreddit like /r/chicagobulls. 

So we wish him luck. You'll see his first weekly post on Saturday morning.

---

As always, in closing, I leave you with these ways to further interact with our community:

4214,A quick clarification of a recent mistake we made,"Last night, several users messaged us to notify us that our automoderator wiki page was no longer public. We did a thorough investigation into how this happened, and it turned out to be an issues with the often used moderator toolbox that you can find at /r/toolbox. It turns out that if you edit the page using the moderator toolbox that when you save the page it not only automatically sends the update to /u/Automoderator but it also checks the page's permissions and sets it to private.

The initial accidental delisting was done by /u/spinnelein and I tested the theory to prove that it can indeed happen just now.

We're obviously going to refrain from the use of toolbox for this in the future or speak to the creator about removing this ""feature,"" but in the future we'd appreciate a nice message about it instead of ~~attempting to start a witch hunt~~ overreacting. We are well intentioned people. 

We can provide screenshots from the moderation log if desired.

Thank you, 

Gaget

If you try to downgrade an iphone ios, the itunes will tell you that your (ios 13) backup is too new to be restored to a older (ios 12) even though they are only 1 year apart. However if you change the info.plst file you can restore the backup. Showing the ""incompatible"" excuse that apple uses is literal bs.

I am sure this also dependent on your provider which theirs is Fido/Rogers(Canada) to enable this. Also, on the  manufacturers to release the update for your smartphones can use this feature.

My question is mostly driven by my interest in the new iPhone SE. I know that one of the big draws to the phone is the guaranteed 5 years of updates. However, I also know that the phone doesn't support the new 5G networks. So, basically what I'm wondering is, will that 5 years of updates even matter, because the phone might be rendered obsolete in 3 years because it can't connect to 5G? Or, is that concern much farther off? This question can also be more general and apply to android and any other phones as well, if that's what the sub requires.",gaewfx,10,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/gaewfx/how_quickly_will_5g_render_phones_that_dont/

Hey guys, this is still a work in progress but I'd love to have your feedback. Feel free to take a look at the code and verify it's secure (https://github.com/menkveldj/nafue). 

&nbsp;


User can share a file that is encrypted client side using a password to generate a Pbkdf2 key to AES 256 encrypt the data before uploading it to s3. The user receives a link to share. The link can only be accessed once. After first time access or 24 hours the link and encrypted file are deleted. The receiver must enter the same password to decrypt and recover the file. **No one but the sharer and receiver know what the actual file is.**

&nbsp;


Upload:

* Choose a file to share
* Choose a complex password to create a Pbkdf2 key with
* AES 256 Encrypt File, file name, file type
* Generate 1 time link and s3 pre-signed upload request
* Upload encrypted blob to s3
* Provide 1 time link to access file



Download:

* Navigate to onetime link
* Generate s3 pre-signed download; delete onetime link
* Download file
* Ask for password (same as used to encrypt)
* Decrypt file
* Provide download prompt


&nbsp;



Still In Progress:

* Add job to delete links after 24 hours; don’t just rely on check when link is requested
* Add job to delete files after 24 hours; don’t just rely on check when link is requested
* Add “how it works” page
* Add “progress page”; currently “mobile” 
* Add Github link to Master

Cron runs every minute on a machine on your local network, and sends your unique user token via a HTTP header to a URL.

The webserver picks up the user token and compares your stored IP to the IP that is now accessing the page - if it has changed, it is updated in the database,

Then, on the webserver, a cron runs every minute to pick up changes in IP addresses - and then uses my domain providers API to update the hostnames assigned to the user token.

4255,"Is it just me, or is desktop/laptop technology falling way behind mobile technology in many ways?","Edit: The following statements are a bit.. rough lol. If you look at the comments you'll see I've changed my mind a bit.

It's always seemed obvious that a desktop or laptop is naturally a technological step up from a mobile device. Besides being more portable, smartphones and tablets have always been inferior computers. However, many observations over time have led me to believe that there is way more innovation in the mobile world, and a lacking in the desktop/laptop world. Here's two things I've noticed:

Mobile operating systems are better. A lot of this is a matter of opinion, but honestly, Android makes Windows look like garbage to me. Microsoft's wrong turn with Windows 8 kind of seems to have doomed them. Windows 10 has reverted a lot of the bad, but it is still a kludgy, confusing, divided system. Even without the Metro disaster, Windows still malfunctions way more than Android. Just today I dealt with a Windows 8.1 machine that had a seemingly irreparable problem with Windows update. How often do you encounter a similar problem in Android? Not only is Android more stable, it seems that every time my phone updates I find an innovative new feature from Google. I'm less familiar with Apple so I have less to say in that area, but I do know that macOS hasn't significantly improved in years. Even when it does, it follows iOS, not the other way around. I've been using Linux on my laptop for several years, and it doesn't match Android or iOS either. As you can tell, I've found myself somewhat frustrated with my options for desktop operating systems.

The second thing I've found is that mobile SoCs seem to be progressing and innovating way more than desktop hardware. Now I'm not an expert in this area so I may be completely wrong, but here's what I've noticed. Intel's processors seem to basically just be getting faster. Don't get me wrong, I know there's a lot of work that goes into continuing to make chips faster. But Qualcomm and Apple are doing some crazy stuff that I haven't seen from Intel. They don't just stop at fast CPUs and GPUs, they incorporate media decoding, image processing, gesture recognition and machine learning right into hardware. Perhaps I'm wrong about this though, it could be that doing those things in hardware is unnecessary in larger implementations where power and heat aren't such issues.

Anyway, sorry for the huge post. I know it sounds kind of like a rant, but I promise it's only observation.",74jjzb,10,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/74jjzb/is_it_just_me_or_is_desktoplaptop_technology/

The new Microsoft Edge browser, based on the same Chromium web engine of Chrome, Opera and Brave, is now available for download. Edge will be automatically pushed by a future Windows update too.    


This standardization is good news for software developers, but unfortunately, too many people will continue using the old Edge browser (with the ""E"" icon) or even worst, the older Internet Explorer, both based on a ""complicated to support"" Microsoft engine. Skipping the Explorer support can save 50% or more of development costs and troubles.   


 Firefox uses Gecko, a different web engine. It's developer Mozilla this week laid off nearly 100 staff since neither donations or premium offers are doing well.    


The 90% of Firefox revenue comes from Google, in exchange for being kept as the default Firefox search engine. No diversification of funding and no other ideas are raising money so far. Google is the developer of Chromium, used by the Firefox competitors.    


In other words, Google keeps up Firefox financially for now; Microsoft could replace Google's funding by paying Firefox to set Bing as the default search engine but would be a similar scenario of having your salary paid by your main competitor.

4260,[Question/Discussion] Why can't you chose your Smartphone's OS?,"Hey, reddit.
There's been a question on my mind for a very long time.
On PC, nearly every OS (well, except OSX) magically seems to work with every Hardware. I've had Windows XP, 7 and now Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 on one (very old) Notebook, and there doesn't seem to be an issue with it. 
Why is it that you don't get the same freedom with your smartphone? I know that you can install [Ubuntu Mobile](https://certification.ubuntu.com/#phone) (yeah, that was a thing) on [third party devices](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices), but only select ones, but aside I've never seen anyone giving away/selling licences for Android or Windows10M.
Basically your smartphone seems to be locked to the OS you buy it with.

Microsoft recently [dropped support](http://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-mobile-creators-update-only-coming-11-eligible-handsets) for a bunch of windows phones, and I've already mentioned Ubuntu only being supported by a handful of devices. Is it a hardware issue? Is there simply no money in the market? What does everybody think (or know) about this?

4261,My router has... Identity issues...,"Late one Saturday night I sat and played some games when suddenly my router disconnects. I restart, check the wireless list and find that the router has changed SSID to the stock name with no wireless security at all. Once more I couldn't connect to the routers Stock Gateway/router address (in this case 192.168.0.1) and found that the router had gone over to bridged mode. It was kind of cool how each Device in my house had it's own dedicated IP, but I figured it must be some update and fancy networking going on that might have that effect (*shrugs inanely*). So I decide wait untill the weekend was over to contact costumer service. Here's where it gets weird:

I call in, explain my situation, I tell him I'm looking at the router Interface for ""Inteno DG-201"" (which is what it says in the title above the login inputs). So he tells me to try the Stock username and passwords, with no luck ofc. So he dishes out a ""Secret password"" for the router and I got in. But something was wrong. It wasn't at all like I remembered it. The background is dark gray now, the text is smaller and it has a TON more features that it never had before. I was sort of stoked thinking ""what kind of psycho firmware update is this? Did they find the bottleneck of all bottlenecks within their tiny little Box?"" But it wasn't all new green pastures. Most of the time when I tried to press a link I got a 400 error. I could go back, press it again, and perhaps a few more times and suddenly the page would show. The guy on the phone told me ""it Works better With internet Explorer"" and I replied ""Yeah, hehe... I'm not using internet Explorer..."" He recipricated and we tried to find how to turn of bridge mode, cause apparently it wasn't OK for me to have access to several different IPs (sadface :( ) After searching a fuck ton more I decided to let the guy off the line, to try and read some manual maybe, find out what this new firmware is about. So I search for the Inteno DG-201 and I find a Picture of this wide router, with two antennas and a crapload of inputs. I was like ""woa, woa, woa... that's not my router. Is it perhaps the DG-201E DirectCU II EXTREME edition?"" I was puzzled as fuck, so I decided to check the router model on the sticker beneath it and I find that it's not the DG-201... it's the friggin' X5671B (both Inteno modem/routers).

So With my New findings I spring to my Smartphone and call the helpdesk again. The same guy answers. I explain what I had found and he was either just as puzzled as me or treading very carefully with what he said (though he said he was somewhat an expert on the Inteno line of routers). What could it have been? A botched firmware update from them, from Inteno, or some router virus. or perhaps.... LAN g-g-g-g-g-ghosts!? I have no Clue to be honest and speculating on it would not be Worth my time. If my ISP _did_ botch the router I dun care. They've provided excellent service for me and I won't mind this - unless it happens again ofc :P Then I might start asking some questions...

4265,Does Nintendo's partnership with NVIDIA point to something more? Could NVIDIA plan on allowing the NX to use its GRID system to stream games over the internet?,"You guys know a bit more about this than me probably....would this be possible?  Outside of NVIDIA expanding their GRID network would anything else need to be done to allow this?  I assume it would be subscription based, and will be rolled out slowly.  

-----------------------------
------------------------------
---------------------------------
------------------------------------
The rumor by Eurogamer saying the console will contain a tegra chip is the most likely rumor to be true so far, which has a lot of people pissed off and are saying its a nail in the coffin for Nintendo for not offering a more powerful system.....What if they partnered with NVIDA not just for its chip, but also to use its GRID network and have NVIDIA and Nintendo both profit from it?

NVIDIA offers its game streaming thru its SHIELD which hasnt sold well, maybe they could plan on using the same game streaming service on an updated network with the NX?  Even if the NX sells bad it will probably sell better than the SHIELD.

This will allow for the NX to display better graphics than the NX hardware is capable of.  They would gain lots of third party support, which they have a problem with, because third party companies would essentially just be releasing their PC versions for NX...it would cost them nothing or next to nothing to have their games on NX(except for paying Nintendo and Nvidia to allow it).

**EDIT:** Also if the tegra rumos are true, Nintendo is probably judging the backlash in the gaming community.  So if they didn't plan on using the GRID network, I am sure they are at least trying to convince NVIDA now or soon that they should partner to offer the service thru NX in the future.

-------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------

**Here are some rumors and business decisions that I think kinda point to this...**

**Rumors about the NX working with PC's and other consoles....**

- Possibly talking about running PC games, and the ability for many console gamers to crossplay with PC users...Meaning that NX users could play something like rocket league with ps4 players and something similar on newer crossplay xbone games.

**An NVIDIA chip being used in a console, which hasnt happened in a long time.**

- Could be NVIDIA being competitive and offering chip cheaply, but I think it points to a much larger partnership.....NVIDIA has the best game streaming network....they want to gain more subscriptions especially after the poor sales of the shield console and Nintendo wants third developer support, which brings me to next point...

**Third party devs, such as Witcher 3 creators, said they are super excited for what they have seen with NX...**

-  when they shouldnt be if the NX can only run Tegra-level graphics.  They sound really enthusiastic like they are not just playing nice with nintendo.  They would have to make entirely different games for a system that might or might not fail if it was designed to run on Tegra...thats a lot of money to invest.  Running PC versions to display to the NX costs developers nothing...These DEVS would not be excited if they knew they would have to create separate games designed for high end tablets!  Its like developing something for the original Wii when compared to the 360!  They would not be so enthusiastic and excited if they knew they couldnt easily transfer their games over to new hardware!  And the main witcher 3 DEV sounded extremely enthusiastic and helped to make one of best looking games ever, and they dont make a lot of games...He should be terrified if they knew the NX only ran on a tablet GPU!  I dont think he was just excited to release the gwent card game!

**Rumors about the docking part being released months after the mobile part.**  

- May take longer for Nvidia to expand network, maybe the docking station has a better display output that allows games to put out at 4k on TVs....Nvidia might want to judge how popular the streaming service will become first by judging it on portable version....requires a lot more bandwidth to display at higher resolutions(Grid 2.0 allows 1080p, but they will eventually want to do it at higher resolutions).  Might be that NVIDIA doesnt have network to display higher resolutions to so many people at first, fact that most people dont have 4k tvs would also make sense why nintendo would hold back on releasing a docking station that increases video output, has better wifi, and ethernet port.

**Nvidia's investment in their game streaming network and the failure of their SHIELD console...**

- NX will sell better than shield even if it sells as bad as Wii U, maybe NVIDIA wants to make more money thru subscriptions and not enough people are buying shields to make it as lucrative as they expected.  When Nvidia discussed its GRID 2.0 update the spokepersons mainly aimed toward remote desktop and running high end application over the internet usually...way less focus was put on the gaming portion, could be that they are giving up on shield but maybe its because they are upgrading their network for reasons they cant say yet publicly....because they hare going to mainly shift their shield gaming subscription service over to the NX!  Thats a lot more people using it, a lot more servers required, and a lot more money they make!

--------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

Anyone into gambling?  Putting odds at 50% it uses NVIDA game streaming services to offer a subscription based or rental type model to play high quality PC games, and it will only work through the docking station and only be offered at home with those with capable internet.  Will also be rolled out slowly and incrementally at first, with plans to have it everywhere within a year or so...

**Just seems like a business partnership made in heaven....Nvidia has the network but cant sell enough hardware to gain or keep users...Nintendo has a history of having shit internet but has the ability to easily outsell the SHIELD.  Nintendo wouldn't have to invest in an expensive game streaming network, NVIDIA wouldn't have to invest in making a new console that might not sell well.  They could both profit heavily from this with minimal investment**

4266,Steam is discontinuing official support for Ubuntu,"Steam users that run Ubuntu may need to start thinking about alternatives to one or the other in the relatively near future.

Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais posted on Twitter that version 19.10 and up of Ubuntu will no longer be officially supported by Steam. Valve will also no longer recommend the world's most popular Linux distribution to its millions of users.

This move is likely due to Ubuntu soon discontinuing support for 32-bit applications, which Steam itself and, arguably more importantly, Wine, are. This compatibility removal will therefore remove support for Steam Play via Proton, software that has opened up opportunities for Linux users to play games previously exclusive to Windows operating system users on PC. Even if Valve were to create a 64-bit version of Steam itself to maintain compatibility with Ubuntu, the loss of Proton and Steam would result in a huge loss of potential library for Linux users, so much so that it arguably wouldn’t be worth it.

In any case, Valve’s gaming-focused Linux distribution SteamOS will remain supported and updated for the foreseeable future, and other Linux distributions that continue to support 32-but applications should be able to run Steam, Steam Play, and Proton just fine. In addition, the company is also ""switch\[ing\] \[its\] focus"" to an as-of-yet to be determined Linux distribution.",c54ihq,1,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/c54ihq/steam_is_discontinuing_official_support_for_ubuntu/

4269,"Aerial 3D holograms a.k.a Plasma holograms in mid-air. Yes, like in Star Wars!","So a development and a potential implementation of aerial (plasma) holograms was in my mind for quite some time and I’ve managed to dig up just a couple of articles on that matter. One about [Aerial Burton](https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/15/aerial-3d-amazing-system-shows-3d-objects-in-mid-air-with-no-screen-video/) and their Aerial 3D holos.
One about [DNG (Digital Nature Group)](https://digitalnature.slis.tsukuba.ac.jp/2015/06/fairy-lights-in-femtoseconds/) with their “fairy lights” powered by femtosecond laser and spatial light modulator.

The latter is far more detailed and received a wider coverage in media back in 2015, however they seemed to move past their holos research into 3D printing and other fields. Burton guys seem to completely abandon their website, however, judging by what’s still there, I can see their technology is much different and doesn’t use femtosecond lasers. They call it plasma laser but it’s not clear what this actually means. Any ideas here?
Burton’s tech also seems more compact -> [Link](http://www.burton-jp.com/en/producten.htm).

To conclude, it seems to me this laser hologram tech has enormous potential (given it will be developed) but both groups haven’t given any updates. Have you heard of any news/researches beside these two? I will be happy to get any hints for my own further research.

Also the exact naming of such thing is yet to be established, so be happy to offer your options 👍",jyt5g6,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/jyt5g6/aerial_3d_holograms_aka_plasma_holograms_in/

What was it like in practice? Was it anything like we have today with smartphone platforms or videogame consoles? Can it be said that having one/very little dominant platforms in whatever category we're speaking of has made things better for everyone? For instance, I & likely plenty of other people personally am saddened that webOS & MeeGo are virtually done for & despite other OS like Jolla Sailfish, FirefoxOS, BB 10, Windows Phone, Ubuntu Phone, etc coming about, it looks like in the smartphone world, the common platforms have been decided to where people will jump into this world buying either iOS or Android, no matter how good something else may be.

Is it usually true that in such format/standard wars, that neither the most open nor most technologically superior standard wins out?

Does anyone else wonder about alternate paths reality could've taken where video, smartphone, & computing platforms these days could've ended up similar to videogame consoles - competition but still having a health industry as a whole, where everyone innovates & the good/best ideas become common practices?

From what I can gather, he had a medical issue during his trip to Mexico and being away from his primary care physician, it appears he died quietly at the hospital while on life support. He is survived by his wife (with child) and two children.

Kuro5hin wasn't exactly a bastion of culture. Originally it was a fork from Slashdot, and the goal was to encourage active development and to beat down the trolls. It enjoyed a smashing success from insightful and interesting posters who could submit essay style articles to the site, which was contrary from slashdot (and reddit's) link-and-run format.

After i installed it, had internet working perfectly, but then after a hic-up i restarted my router, and the internet connection was gone, but it still showed the wifi signal, tho my connection was ""limited""
Question 1) What caused this? Maybe it was some sort of driver reset or settings got reset? :o
I did a system restore to a previous point and my internet got fixed, then i was restarted my pc in order to install updates, but after that i kept getting error 651, which told me that raspppoe.sys driver file was broken or corrupted or w/e and i replaced it, still didnt change a thing...always a random dial-up connection kept showing up and failing to connect that way, but i am still connected to the internet through wi-fi and able to surf.
2) How to fix that raspppoe.sys file or 651 error specifically for win 8.
Massive question incoming, how do i uninstall this horrible windows 8 and install windows 7 which is way better for me. Somewhere i found a rumor that i wont be able to do that because HP computers dont support the downgrade? (Hewlett-Packard p6-2485eo) model of my pc.

I found that i would need to disable secure boot and enable CSM. 
3)Is that it? or do i have to do something else? How do i do enable CSM and disable secure boot? Ofc change first boot device to CD/dvd and wait for win 7 to install? Do i have to delete my partitions or just format them?

More. What about internet? Will windows 7 let me set up my internet connection manually while installing? Because i dont have any Ethernet or Video card drivers(which im going to install after im done with win 7)

4279,Another steller response from gitlab,"They rolled back the telemetry they had planned after seeing their users did not want this.      After the steller (And incredibly transparent) response from gitlab durring the desiaster two years ago here is more from them

&#x200B;

Dear GitLab users and customers,  
On October 23, we sent an email entitled “Important Updates to our Terms of Service and Telemetry Services” announcing upcoming changes. Based on considerable feedback from our customers, users, and the broader community, we reversed course the next day and removed those changes before they went into effect. Further, GitLab will commit to not implementing telemetry in our products that sends usage data to a third-party product analytics service. This clearly struck a nerve with our community and I apologize for this mistake.  
So, what happened? In an effort to improve our user experience, we decided to implement user behavior tracking with both first and third-party technology. Clearly, our evaluation and communication processes for rolling out a change like this were lacking and we need to improve those processes. But that’s not the main thing we did wrong.  
Our main mistake was that we did not live up to our own core value of collaboration by including our users, contributors, and customers in the strategy discussion and, for that, I am truly sorry. It shouldn’t have surprised us that you have strong feelings about opt-in/opt-out decisions, first versus third-party tracking, data protection, security, deployment flexibility and many other topics, and we should have listened first.  
So, where do we go from here? The first step is a retrospective that is happening on October 29 to document what went wrong. We are reaching out to customers who expressed concerns and collecting feedback from users and the wider community. We will put together a new proposal for improving the user experience and share it for feedback. We made a mistake by not collaborating, so now we will take as much time as needed to make sure we get this right. You can be part of the collaboration by posting comments in this issue: [https://gitlab.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=195066e322642c622c0ecdde3&id=8c8ee4d0c6&e=e6e0d482f7](https://gitlab.us3.list-manage.com/track/click?u=195066e322642c622c0ecdde3&id=8c8ee4d0c6&e=e6e0d482f7). If you are a customer, you may also reach out to your GitLab representative if you have additional feedback.  
I am glad you hold GitLab to a higher standard. If we are going to be transparent and collaborative, we need to do it consistently and learn from our mistakes.

4280,"Non-obvious learnings in launching current startup, after co-founding 2 startups that were acquired and 1 IPO","I posted on here before when we first launched, I wanted to update you guys on some of the learnings we’ve had.

I feel compelled to share this. I'm addicted to building products people want to use. Most people think that once you have a few wins under your belt, it's easy sailing for the next startup. I think that's only partly true. Here's some context and what I think of as non-obvious learnings.
I built my last venture-funded startup to $18M in revenue a year and was acquired. We then took the acquirer public (NYSE: TRMR). I'm now back building my next startup [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech). 
 
**Team-building** - This gets easier, as you know who the good people are at early stages and who you have chemistry with. However, if you work with the same people you have been successful with, the strengths of having the flow and chemistry sometimes might translate into the weakness of not being paranoid. You don’t want to be stuck on a certain wavelength of thinking and not add fresh blood into key conversations. I have seen this occasionally and it’s subtle. This way of thinking brought us success before, so it’ll work again this time. Not necessarily true. 
 
**Finding Product / Market fit** - Experience and calcified assumptions can be a bad thing. You tend to think less disruptively if you are not as wide-eyed. One of the learnings we had early on when starting the current company was to find a space with problems we were intimately familiar with as users and passionate about solving, but not a domain we knew much about in terms of how things were done. This way, we didn't feel shackled by assumptions. Our pain point for remote collaboration. We weren't as productive as we wanted to be on existing video conferencing systems. A lot of innovation was in supporting as many users as possible in a session. We thought for teams looking to get things done, there was little innovation in amplifying team's productivity. So we built [Cyclops.io] (https://www.cyclops.io/slack?utm_source=reddit-tech), a video conferencing platform with productivity tools on top. What was a bit non-obvious was that we have to reset ourselves to have a lot of humility in testing assumptions and re-building our network of contacts.
 
**Fund-raising** - This gets easier too since we are credible entrepreneurs with wins. That said, the surprising thing is sometimes we get questions around if we were too experienced and not wide-eyed enough. Raising too much money can turn into a downward spiral as you might be tempted to spend too much too quickly and lose the discipline that comes with a small budget.  
 
**Distribution Model** - This was probably the biggest learning. Our current business was very different than our last one. How we get to customers is extremely different. The times have also changed - how users buy certain types of software have also started to transition from field sales to inside sales and self-service. Getting up to speed here took time. We used to have a field sales driven organization that was expensive to build. Now, we are innovating on self-service to make cost of sales much lower. 
 
**Mindset** - This is probably the most important. Thematically, you just have to have a scrappy mindset again. You have to fight every dollar spent and get every dollar in. Question every assumption. Vet every investor and potential hire.
 
Overall, there’s a little grain of truth to the old line “the more experience you have, the less you know”, especially in a fast-changing segment. You just gotta keep your head steady and assume nothing.

4281,Looking for spikes. How to increase the effectiveness of your dashboard,"Consider this:

A product manager asks an analyst: “Please make a dashboard where we can see Day 1, Day 3 and Day 7 retention rates in dynamics.”

“Are you sure?” the analyst asks. “These charts will be quite noisy. Just look how much the metrics alter from day to day. Maybe it’s a better idea to monitor the weekly retention rates instead. In this case, any random fluctuations will be smoothed out. ”

They called it a deal.

Now a new dot appears on the dashboard once a week. This dot has “Everything is fine, nothing has changed” written all over it. But sometimes, the storms of everyday life are hidden behind this apparent calm: days of ups and downs, victories and defeats that happen during weekdays and weekends.

But no one on the product team finds out about them because everyone is looking at weekly metrics. Consequently, they’re missing both the random and meaningful fluctuations.

# Why do we need dashboards?

One of the important questions that a dashboard serves to answer to product managers is “Is everything all right?” Based on the answer, there are two possible paths:

* If everything is fine, then the product manager can get back to her regular routine and carry on with her scheduled tasks.
* If some important metric has changed in a drastic way, then she must investigate it as soon as possible and come up with a plan of action.If you have a dashboard, then it’s good.

If you monitor this dashboard and use it as described earlier, then great.

To make it excellent, however, you need to change the key question that your dashboard answers.

# A spike

I first heard about the concept of spikes when I was at a theatre. It was a play about [David Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Yang_(entrepreneur)), an angel investor, serial entrepreneur, and founder and Chairman of the board of ABBYY.

In one of the scenes, scientists at a university research laboratory were conducting experiments. During the experiments, the scientists looked for what they called “spikes” on graphs (a steep rise or fall on a graph).

If there was no ”spike” and everything looked predictable, then it wasn’t interesting science-wise.

If there was a “spike,” it was clear that something interesting was happening. There was a chance to make a discovery, a breakthrough. In general, everyone was looking for spikes.

# Spikes and dashboards

Every day, something new happens to your products. Today, you’re going viral on mainstream media; yesterday, you changed the keywords for your app in the app store; the day before, a heavy rainfall drowned the city, or the team might have rolled out an update. Each point on your dashboard’s graphs represents the result of an experiment that the world (sometimes with your help) runs on your product.

Become a research scientist. Instead of asking the dashboard “Is everything OK?” ask “Is there a spike? Is there something I can learn from?” And at this moment, the changes that you used to interpret as mere accidents will push you to start learning new things about your product and your users.

Keep looking for “spikes.” Get to the very core of where they come from. Many of them will turn out to be happenstance and will hold nothing interesting to explore. But this doesn’t mean you should stop searching.

Some “spikes” will be caused by factors you haven’t thought of before, factors that can impact the metrics of your product. And this is exactly what you should be looking for: the levers that will help you move the product forward.

# What should we look for?

Don’t only look for positive changes in your dashboard. Make sure to search for the negative ones as well. If something has ruined the metrics, then moving in the opposite direction will most likely improve them.

Investigate the reasons behind the spikes. Dig deeper. If you find a reason, but it doesn’t fully explain what is happening, then keep looking.

Perhaps you will find out that the conversion rate and overall effectiveness of ad banners increased during a competitor’s television ad campaign. So why not raise your bid or allocate some extra budget during the competitor’s campaign?

Maybe a thought leader’s post on social media has brought you traffic of a much better quality than paid ads. Perhaps it makes sense to start working more closely with thought leaders?

Or let’s say the number of app downloads has doubled in one small country. Why so? How can we replicate this success in other countries?

Yet again, maybe an accidental change in the settings of the technology underlying in product suddenly caused the key product metrics to collapse. This might mean that by improving the quality of this technology, we can improve the metrics.

None of the situations described above are hypothetical; they are true stories from my own experience. And each one of them led us to significant breakthroughs.

# A case from personal experience

Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, I worked on a mobile app called Assistant. It was the most popular smart voice assistant developed by [API.AI](https://dialogflow.com/) (the app is no longer available after Google acquired API.AI; it’s now called Dialogflow).

One day, we launched a sale in the Assistant app. It wasn’t anything special – we had many similar sales before. After the sales day, I opened the dashboard to check the results. Everything looked normal. I was about to close the dashboard when I noticed something unusual.

Our routine during monthly sales was to send push notifications in ten different languages to our users. Usually, conversion rates for push notifications were similar across different languages. But in this specific case, I observed a significantly higher conversion rate for the Spanish notifications.

I decided to investigate the “spike” I found and postpone other plans to some other time. It didn’t take me too long to find the potential reason for the increase in the conversion rate. It turned out that when I had edited the notification, I had only copied the first part of the message in its Spanish version. The original, English version of the notification message was, “I have a surprise for you! Here is your 50% off deal!” But the Spanish version only read, “I have a surprise for you!”

My impression was that the conversion rate would be lower in a push notification that excluded the discount context. Many companies that provide push notification services regularly stated this in their reports.

However, I didn’t find any other explanation for the spike. So we decided to experiment with this idea and don’t mention the discount in the next sale for all the languages.

As a result, purchases doubled on our next sales day. In the next update, we did the same to our regular sales, and it increased our overall revenue by 8%. This was a significant improvement, considering the fact that the app’s yearly run rate was several million dollars.

Thus, a small unexpected fluctuation in the dashboard chart that resulted from a random error gave us quite a big increase in revenue.

*Note: I should say this doesn’t mean the same thing will work for your app. In the case I described, a number of product features went hand in hand to provide this missing-discount effect.*

# Skyeng case study

And here is an interesting case from Skyeng, a popular online school that teaches English:

*Free introductory lessons are part of our sales funnel. During these lessons a teacher determines the level of the student and her goals.*

*One day, we noticed that one of our teacher’s conversion rate from an introductory lesson into paying student was stably higher, and we are talking about 20%, which is a lot. For a long time, we tried to figure out what was the reason. We studied all of her lessons in detail but didn’t find any explanation.*

*Then we noticed that while all teachers had identical topics for their students’ introductory lesson, this teacher always had different tasks and topics for the first lessons she gave. It turned out that she looked for her students’ names in advance, and was trying to get to know her students’ hobbies a little better through social networks and search engines. She discovered what sort of things they liked and then selected the topics her potential client might like.*

*We set up the same business process for all our new clients, and now, when a person comes to us, we already know her interests and understand what we can offer. The conversion rate of our introductory lessons have increased from 60 to 75%.*

# Summing it up

The manager from our story at the beginning of this article instinctively understands that he needs noisy metrics and “spikes.” These noisy metrics and spikes can reveal something valuable that you won’t be able to find otherwise.

The analyst suggests monitoring the average metrics, which on the one hand reduces the influence of randomness, but also conceals a lot of useful information.

Here’s my advice: don’t be afraid of noisy metrics. Make sure to look for “spikes” on your dashboards. Study them. Find out the reasons behind them. Do not be quick to attribute the fluctuations you find to the game of chance or seasonality.

The dashboard that says “Everything is fine” should upset you, as it doesn’t carry any information to work with. Fluctuations are your chance for discoveries and breakthroughs.

4291,Reddit 101,"## What is reddit, really?  

* Don't think of reddit as one giant community. This site is made up of ""sub""reddits, which are all their own communities. Every single post you see on this site belongs to its own community, with its own set of users, and with its own set of rules. reddit provides you an easy-to-use interface for managing what posts you see by letting you subscribe or unsubscribe from certain subreddits.  

* By making an account, you are automatically subscribed to a set of [""default"" subreddits](http://i.imgur.com/4PxSX4e.png) which are a set of highly popular communities that the administrators of this site feel would give the average person an interesting first experience.  

* Don't like one or more of these default subreddits? Use the ""unsubscribe"" button on the sidebar, and start customizing your reddit front page! Find subreddits that interest *you*. Many subreddits feature lists of ""similar subreddits"" that will help you find other awesome places to subscribe to. Looking for a subreddit but you just don't know its name? Try /r/findareddit! Finally, try setting up a [multi-reddit](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/browse-future-of-reddit-re-introducing.html) to categorize your subreddit list even further! 

---  

## Tips for your account.  

* [See and change your preferences.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/) Customize how many [comments](http://i.imgur.com/ZDka3tA.png) show up, what kind of [posts](http://i.imgur.com/FqnC5e2.png) show up, [and more](http://i.imgur.com/vFrZ1C9.png)!  

* [Verify your e-mail.](https://ssl.reddit.com/prefs/update/) If you don't do this and you lose your password, you will have no way to log back onto that account. Ever. Please do this!  

* Karma is a point system that lets you know how your submissions or comments are doing. The more karma your post has, the more people have upvoted it. Generally a higher karma count on a post means that the community of that subreddit found your post valuable and interesting. Your karma is logged on your user page on the top right. **Please note that self-posts earn you no karma.** Only comments and link-posts do.

## What is the sidebar?  

* The [""sidebar""](http://i.imgur.com/OVtMd4K.png) is the list of information pertaining to a specific subreddit. At the top you will find a link to submit a post and a link to search the subreddit. It also contains the link to ""subscribe/unsubscribe"" from that subreddit. Underneath that it generally lists the rules, guidelines, relevant information, similar subreddits, etc.  

    **Note:** many mobile reddit apps require you to press a certain button for the sidebar to show up. Every subreddit has a sidebar. Please don't forget to look for it even if your app doesn't immediately show it! [Here's an image showing where to find it on common reddit apps.](http://imgur.com/a/kgwuy#0)

* You should always read the sidebar before submitting a post to any subreddit, and if you don't understand a rule message the moderators to ask. This ensures that your post stays on the subreddit, as rule-breaking posts will likely be removed.

* Have a question about a submission to a particular subreddit? Ask the moderators there! [Here's an image](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) that shows you where you can typically find the link to message the mods.  

---

## Who are moderators? What do they do?  

* Each subreddit is a community with its own focus. The mods are volunteers who ensure the subreddit stays true to its purpose by enforcing set rules. For example, /r/android is a subreddit dedicated to discussion of the Android operating system. Anything not directly related to Android is removed by its moderators. Similarly, /r/apple is a subreddit dedicated to discussing Apple and its products.  

* Moderators have the power to approve or remove any comments or submissions made to *only the subreddits they moderate.* They can also issue a ban for users on their subreddit. Moderators enforce the rules laid out in the sidebar, so if you follow all the rules in the sidebar you should be good!  

## Who are admins? What do they do?  

* [Meet the admins.](http://www.reddit.com/about/team) The admins are like super-moderators. They have all the abilities of moderators across every subreddit plus more. They are paid employees of the site and they ensure that the site runs smoothly for all users.

* The admins are generally hands-off when it comes to individual subreddits, letting the moderators and the community decide how its run. **However,** the admins will enforce the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) on every subreddit. Be familiar with these rules. Failure to follow these rules may earn you a **sitewide ban**, or the closing down of a subreddit.  

---

## What is reddiquette?  

* [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) is an **informal** set of guidelines to follow before commenting or submitting on reddit. As reddit has grown, certain behaviors have been frowned upon and other behaviors have been encouraged. reddiquette spells out these behaviors so you aren't left wondering why your posts aren't well-received. You might not be banned not following reddiquette, but you will probably be showered in downvotes if you don't.  

---  

## Help! What happened to my post?  

* reddit is a huge forum with millions of users. Many posts are made here every day. Many, many posts are made with the intention to spam or harass other users. Other posts just don't fit the subreddit. Moderators have to filter through these posts every day to ensure their subreddit stays on topic and free of hostility. Some moderators use bots to help them report posts, some moderators do it all themselves. Every subreddit is different. If you find your post not showing up in the subreddit, your best bet is to ask the moderators there why it's not showing up. *Please note: when you message the moderators, ALL moderators can read it! It's a shared inbox!*  

    * *I can still see my post but others say they can't?*  
    Nothing is really removed from reddit, if a mod removes something it is de-listed for others to see. You can still see it with a direct link.  

    * *My post was removed because it was spam? What gives?*
    Spam is a tricky subject, reddit has several base rules but much of it is left for moderators to decide. reddit's [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq) has a good section explaining it.

---  

## I have a great idea for a subreddit!

* Awesome! [Message the moderators](http://i.imgur.com/asq0ZhO.png) so you can talk to them  

## I have a great idea for reddit as a site!

* Awesome too! Post it in /r/ideasfortheadmins  

## What if I don't like the moderators or how the subreddit is run?  

* That's okay, reddit was built to handle just that! First though, make sure that you talk to the moderators of that subreddit just to be sure there aren't any misunderstandings, or if you can't just compromise. Otherwise, make your own community! [Here is an excellent guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/creesch/wiki/mod101) for starting and moderating your own subreddit.  

* Moderators are people, too, so if you want your voice heard consider messaging them politely with your concerns. We care about the communities we help run and would hate to see users leave because of something that we can help fix!  


---

## What if I need help with something else?  

* Try /r/help for general help on reddit. /r/askmoderators can also help you out if you need to ask mods about anything.  

## I think I found a bug.

* Uh oh. If you are using an application or extension, most have a subreddit you can post in! (/r/RESIssues, /r/alienblue, /r/redditisfun). If you found a bug with reddit itself, post it to /r/bugs (more serious issues should be sent directly to the reddit security team: see the /r/bugs sidebar for contact information.)  


##Other Subreddits of Note

* Other good subreddits to check out for help with various topics are /r/Modhelp, /r/Modnews, /r/ChangeLog, /r/Blog, and /r/Announcements.

4383,[Discussion] Portrayal of Artificial Intelligence in Media,"Media sensationalizing stories is hardly news, but I wanted to see what all you guys' opinion on how a lot of media presents a distorted image on the current state of artificial intelligence and what effects that would have on society and their perception of the field.

From what I've seen of articles talking about artificial intelligence, many paint the image that every major tech company has a skynet within their system that is a living being on the verge of self awareness and will take over the world. They address AI programs as living beings with thoughts. And even the companies that are AI developers seem to advertise it as such. One major example being the ads for IBM Watson.

One particular example that I find is the epitome of this kind of journalism is this article: http://www.ntd.tv/2017/07/31/facebook-kills-ai-that-made-its-own-language-here-are-5-times-ai-got-creepy/

My biggest problem with this article specifically is that the AI's ""new language"" is most likely a mistake. What is probably happening is the AI is finding patterns in the English language that just aren't the standard rules for English grammar. Yet the media repackages it as a creepy development that means robots will kill us all.

In my experience with AI, we are nowhere near the singularity and are, in fact, pretty idiotic. They have trouble performing tasks that are much simpler than self awareness. However, my knowledge of AI is restricted to a bunch of novelty projects I've seen around the internet and my personal experience using neural networks for projects.

4389,"ELI5: Why do newer messaging/calling apps including Allo/Duo, WhatsApp, and Signal REQUIRE a mobile phone number?","As the world moves more and more to internet-based communication, traditional phone plans and SMS are becoming more and more obsolete.

Personally, I have access to WiFi at home, school, and work. I have a data plan for my tablet so that I can stay connected even when I'm out and about. So with the growing ubiquity of VOIP and online messaging, you'd think I should be in constant contact with almost everyone I know at all times. I can say goodbye to the silly, outdated cost of a calling/SMS plan from a mobile provider.

But there's a missing link in the chain: since I don't have a mobile phone, I don't have a mobile phone number, so I'm not allowed to use several of the most popular VOIP or messaging apps.

So what the heck is going on? That doesn't make any sense. Since these apps are aiming to disrupt the traditional messaging paradigm, shouldn't they be actively facilitating the abandonment of traditional phone numbers?

It of course makes sense that these apps can link to your phone number to find contacts. Such a move makes it easier for people to find each other on the apps, which means a quicker death to traditional phone calls and SMS. But they REQUIRE a phone number?

4390,Is a Bachelors worth it in the Cyber-Security field?,"So I am a freshman in high school and I signed up for a early college program in cyber security. It gives me a associates degree in cyber security and a few certificates for Cisco and other things. So I would then have an associates degree in cyber security at the age of 19. My parents want me to continue on and get a bachelors in college. They will pay for collage but I feel like I could save them money if I didnt do that and I would be 21 at that time. I guess I am asking if companies would rather have someone younger (19) with an associates or 21 with a bachelors. I would also like to add I'm in-between Baltimore and D.C (the hottest place for cyber security(I am about 15 minutes away from NSA)) if that makes any difference. Probably the main reason I was wondering this is that I am in chorus and would have to drop that for a language and wouldn't be able to sing anymore for school, and I know most schools want at least 3 years of a language.

Since i just downloaded a bunch of stuff i was worried. Well then i uninstalled the programs i had installed earlier and nothing worked. So i scanned my PC with 3 different anti-virus softwares and deleted every virus i found, still can't connect to Google. So i figured someone must have hacked into my internet and setup a fake Google site right?(I am no good with computers) After trying everything:blocking some connections even restoring my PC to the day before, i was ready to give up. I was going to have to get used to Bing from now on. Well what do you know Bing is not so bad after all, i find a forum and i don't even read the topic i just scroll down to the comment and see something about changing the date on your computer, so i remember i changed it earlier to get another program to work and right there i knew that's got to be it, i see no other way, and i changed it and now its working just as before!:)

4393,Looking for spikes. How to increase the effectiveness of your dashboard,"Consider this:

A product manager asks an analyst: “Please make a dashboard where we can see Day 1, Day 3 and Day 7 retention rates in dynamics.”

“Are you sure?” the analyst asks. “These charts will be quite noisy. Just look how much the metrics alter from day to day. Maybe it’s a better idea to monitor the weekly retention rates instead. In this case, any random fluctuations will be smoothed out. ”

They called it a deal.

Now a new dot appears on the dashboard once a week. This dot has “Everything is fine, nothing has changed” written all over it. But sometimes, the storms of everyday life are hidden behind this apparent calm: days of ups and downs, victories and defeats that happen during weekdays and weekends.

But no one on the product team finds out about them because everyone is looking at weekly metrics. Consequently, they’re missing both the random and meaningful fluctuations.

# Why do we need dashboards?

One of the important questions that a dashboard serves to answer to product managers is “Is everything all right?” Based on the answer, there are two possible paths:

* If everything is fine, then the product manager can get back to her regular routine and carry on with her scheduled tasks.
* If some important metric has changed in a drastic way, then she must investigate it as soon as possible and come up with a plan of action.If you have a dashboard, then it’s good.

If you monitor this dashboard and use it as described earlier, then great.

To make it excellent, however, you need to change the key question that your dashboard answers.

# A spike

I first heard about the concept of spikes when I was at a theatre. It was a play about [David Yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Yang_(entrepreneur)), an angel investor, serial entrepreneur, and founder and Chairman of the board of ABBYY.

In one of the scenes, scientists at a university research laboratory were conducting experiments. During the experiments, the scientists looked for what they called “spikes” on graphs (a steep rise or fall on a graph).

If there was no ”spike” and everything looked predictable, then it wasn’t interesting science-wise.

If there was a “spike,” it was clear that something interesting was happening. There was a chance to make a discovery, a breakthrough. In general, everyone was looking for spikes.

# Spikes and dashboards

Every day, something new happens to your products. Today, you’re going viral on mainstream media; yesterday, you changed the keywords for your app in the app store; the day before, a heavy rainfall drowned the city, or the team might have rolled out an update. Each point on your dashboard’s graphs represents the result of an experiment that the world (sometimes with your help) runs on your product.

Become a research scientist. Instead of asking the dashboard “Is everything OK?” ask “Is there a spike? Is there something I can learn from?” And at this moment, the changes that you used to interpret as mere accidents will push you to start learning new things about your product and your users.

Keep looking for “spikes.” Get to the very core of where they come from. Many of them will turn out to be happenstance and will hold nothing interesting to explore. But this doesn’t mean you should stop searching.

Some “spikes” will be caused by factors you haven’t thought of before, factors that can impact the metrics of your product. And this is exactly what you should be looking for: the levers that will help you move the product forward.

# What should we look for?

Don’t only look for positive changes in your dashboard. Make sure to search for the negative ones as well. If something has ruined the metrics, then moving in the opposite direction will most likely improve them.

Investigate the reasons behind the spikes. Dig deeper. If you find a reason, but it doesn’t fully explain what is happening, then keep looking.

Perhaps you will find out that the conversion rate and overall effectiveness of ad banners increased during a competitor’s television ad campaign. So why not raise your bid or allocate some extra budget during the competitor’s campaign?

Maybe a thought leader’s post on social media has brought you traffic of a much better quality than paid ads. Perhaps it makes sense to start working more closely with thought leaders?

Or let’s say the number of app downloads has doubled in one small country. Why so? How can we replicate this success in other countries?

Yet again, maybe an accidental change in the settings of the technology underlying in product suddenly caused the key product metrics to collapse. This might mean that by improving the quality of this technology, we can improve the metrics.

None of the situations described above are hypothetical; they are true stories from my own experience. And each one of them led us to significant breakthroughs.

# A case from personal experience

Let me tell you a story. A few years ago, I worked on a mobile app called Assistant. It was the most popular smart voice assistant developed by [API.AI](https://dialogflow.com/) (the app is no longer available after Google acquired API.AI; it’s now called Dialogflow).

One day, we launched a sale in the Assistant app. It wasn’t anything special – we had many similar sales before. After the sales day, I opened the dashboard to check the results. Everything looked normal. I was about to close the dashboard when I noticed something unusual.

Our routine during monthly sales was to send push notifications in ten different languages to our users. Usually, conversion rates for push notifications were similar across different languages. But in this specific case, I observed a significantly higher conversion rate for the Spanish notifications.

I decided to investigate the “spike” I found and postpone other plans to some other time. It didn’t take me too long to find the potential reason for the increase in the conversion rate. It turned out that when I had edited the notification, I had only copied the first part of the message in its Spanish version. The original, English version of the notification message was, “I have a surprise for you! Here is your 50% off deal!” But the Spanish version only read, “I have a surprise for you!”

My impression was that the conversion rate would be lower in a push notification that excluded the discount context. Many companies that provide push notification services regularly stated this in their reports.

However, I didn’t find any other explanation for the spike. So we decided to experiment with this idea and don’t mention the discount in the next sale for all the languages.

As a result, purchases doubled on our next sales day. In the next update, we did the same to our regular sales, and it increased our overall revenue by 8%. This was a significant improvement, considering the fact that the app’s yearly run rate was several million dollars.

Thus, a small unexpected fluctuation in the dashboard chart that resulted from a random error gave us quite a big increase in revenue.

*Note: I should say this doesn’t mean the same thing will work for your app. In the case I described, a number of product features went hand in hand to provide this missing-discount effect.*

# Skyeng case study

And here is an interesting case from Skyeng, a popular online school that teaches English:

*Free introductory lessons are part of our sales funnel. During these lessons a teacher determines the level of the student and her goals.*

*One day, we noticed that one of our teacher’s conversion rate from an introductory lesson into paying student was stably higher, and we are talking about 20%, which is a lot. For a long time, we tried to figure out what was the reason. We studied all of her lessons in detail but didn’t find any explanation.*

*Then we noticed that while all teachers had identical topics for their students’ introductory lesson, this teacher always had different tasks and topics for the first lessons she gave. It turned out that she looked for her students’ names in advance, and was trying to get to know her students’ hobbies a little better through social networks and search engines. She discovered what sort of things they liked and then selected the topics her potential client might like.*

*We set up the same business process for all our new clients, and now, when a person comes to us, we already know her interests and understand what we can offer. The conversion rate of our introductory lessons have increased from 60 to 75%.*

# Summing it up

The manager from our story at the beginning of this article instinctively understands that he needs noisy metrics and “spikes.” These noisy metrics and spikes can reveal something valuable that you won’t be able to find otherwise.

The analyst suggests monitoring the average metrics, which on the one hand reduces the influence of randomness, but also conceals a lot of useful information.

Here’s my advice: don’t be afraid of noisy metrics. Make sure to look for “spikes” on your dashboards. Study them. Find out the reasons behind them. Do not be quick to attribute the fluctuations you find to the game of chance or seasonality.

The dashboard that says “Everything is fine” should upset you, as it doesn’t carry any information to work with. Fluctuations are your chance for discoveries and breakthroughs.

4394,Zero to tech job? [serious],"This is going to sound horrible and probably insulting, but please take it seriously. 

I am interested in IT. It seems like there are a lot of jobs available for it, and a lot of people on reddit do it for a living and seem like the kind of folks I wouldn't mind being associated with. Other computer-related careers are interesting too, but at this point, I don't know the difference between a lot of them.

I have a BA in political science and an AAS in radiologic technology (x-ray). I live in the rural midwest. I would like to relocate to the southeast coast in the next couple years. I work as a medical secretary / telemetry tech watching heart monitors now.

I can work a computer, but I can't program one. I can take mine apart and put it back together and change out components if I need to. The only tech credentials I have are in radiologic technology. I can work an x-ray machine and a CT machine and the computers that run them. I have worked with HBOC and AS/400. I know HTML and CSS. That's it.

I'm open to self-teaching and using the many educational site that are available. I'm open to taking classes at the community college. There isn't a university within 100 miles of me right now, and I can't afford one right now anyway. So that's where I am now.

Do you have any specific, focused suggestions that can get me from where I am now to having recruiters hunt me down for a $40k tech job in Charleston within the next 2 years?

Thanks for any specific advice you can give. I'm looking for things like what languages are the most immediately valuable (like is learning C++ more important than learning C?)? What certifications will get me a job immediately? Things like that.

Again, I know I probably sound like an ass for coming here out of nowhere and thinking I can do the job you went to school for years to learn, and I apologize for that.

At first, I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, and assumed that I was *maybe* talking to someone following a script.  By the end, I was fairly sure that I was talking to either a bot, or a human with such minimal grasp of the English language that they may as well be such.  So, why did Charter make me sit around and wait just to chat with a bot?",7ef9z4,143,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/7ef9z4/why_does_charter_make_me_wait_to_chat_with_a_bot/
4396,Free Degree of Computer Science using MIT OpenCourseware,"I want to create a study team to do the MIT Challenge. I created a curriculum of 180 credits and I'm thinking in achieve it in 1 year and somethink like two months. I can help you in all you need related to this, the schedule, books, etc. There's a slack team where we all share. (THIS IS JUST FOR KNOWLEDGE, MIT IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU A REAL DEGREE)

EDIT 15/04/2017 Link to the curriculum that I made: [MIT CHALLENGE CURRICULUM](http://imgur.com/QwigriC) 

What I did before starting and some tips:

  1. I planned it for a month due to several things. I'm from Venezuela and I have my own company. I live of the money that I make. So I bringed a friend to my company and make him a business partner with the condition that he has to do all the work. This was perfect since I'm doing 8 hours per day of study. 

   2. Another thing that is important and people forget it; a good CHAIR. If you're going to spend 8 hours every day, 4 hours on weekend, a  good chair is an important thing and not just a furniture.

   3. I made a lot of noise of what I was about to do with my friends and family in order to make this challenge a real thing and keep a little of pressure on me.

   4. Economic situation here in my country is ugly, so it's not common to have your own house, even if you have money. So I live with my family and they make a lot of noise, luckily for me, my house is not small and I fixed a room-garage just for studying and work.

  I studied an intensive week of pre-calculus before starting just to remember some math that I forgot

Are you suited for this?

 * People who is interested in Computer Science

 * People with time to learn Computer Science, this may not be a formal degree but you should take it like one

 * People with discipline

 * People friendly and willing to collaborate

 * People wanting to be tech-entrepeneurs

What do you need? 

 * A computer, basically any computer will work. 

 * Time for spend 6-9 hours a day depending on your effort 

 * A good chair to spend those hours 

 * Willingness!


A little thing about me: I studied Philosophy first and then Economics in college, I never finished none of them. I started my own company and that was my life three years until now. I always hated school and college, but I never hated to learn. So I started to see that I didn't need the traditional educational system to learn. That's when I heard about the MIT CHALLENGE done by Scott H Young. Inspired by him, I made my own curriculum and my own structure on how to accomplish this, I'm going to write later some rules that I made for this.

The rules that I made to give some structure (Test mode):


1. 12 hours/unit on every subject, MIT recommend 14 hours/unit. Scott H. Young did 6 hours/unit

2. If you don't understand something you may go to a prior subject in order to understand the premise.

3. It is supposed that a subject with 12 units (like most of them) should be done in 3 weeks, working on them 8 hours monday to friday and 4 hours each day of the weeknd, to a weekly total of 48 hours and a 3 weeks total of 144 hours. If something unexpected happens you can rearrange your time to compensate this in other days, but the total hours should be done in 3 weeks with just a few extraordinary exceptions. It is to be seen if this methodology will work.

4. If Rule #3 is broked, you will have 5 days more to finish the total hours, but with a new total of 14 hours per unit to a total of 168 hours in a 12 unit subject

5. You should have at least 180 units when you're done (This is what MIT consider a Major). This could be consider that the Major is complete (If there's no a thesis or final project)

6. (It is to be seen if it is possible to have a few days free between the subjects)

7. The general way to test your knowledge will be through the final exam if this is possible. If you fail in this test you will have two days to study for a similar test gain, and this way so on if the resources allowed it. It is to be seen what would happen if the resources are not available.




   Two days ago I started with my first subject, Introduction To Computer Science and Programming in Python. I'm going to test if it's possible to finish this first subject within the time that should be done and if I can keep with the hours per day. I'm starting to see that the feedback when you're doing programming problems would be nice with another students.
Note: I want to add that my native language is NOT english, so there are things that are a little harder for me to understand while studying than to a native english speaker.

Note 2: I want to clarify that many of the subjects are electives that you can choose.

EDIT 16/04/2017: A Slack Team was created for people who wants to do the challenge. Everyone who joins to the slack team are encourage to look first the two posts, ""Team Community Rules"" and ""General things about this team and the Challenge"" in the channel #general_rules, then you can proceed to start in the #how_to_start channel

EDIT: I noticed that some people have taken this post bad, saying it's impossible, etc. By no means I'm trying to diminish the value of people getting degrees at colleges, if it sounds like that I apologize. This is a post solely to create a team that really believes that this can be done. The benefits of self educations are many as the benefits of traditional education are many too, it depends on what you are looking for and your context. Not everyones lives in developed countries nor everyone has the money to afford a good education. The 3 weeks estimated time is just that an estimated, the evaluations are there for something, to test your knowledge. If a subject doesn't have the evaluations I encourage you to look for other options, like asking teachers to help you with that. And if it takes you more than 144 hours or 168 hours is OK, if MIT would have said that you need 20 hours per unit I would have place an estimatted effort of 240 hours for a 12 unit course instead of 168 . But you need to have a goal and a standard time in order to keep you motivated. A degree on MIT has 360 credits, in this challenge we are just studying for the major in CS 180 credits + Calculus and two Physics. Also you're free to learn different subjects at the same time, I just prefer to study one at a time.",65nr7p,173,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/65nr7p/free_degree_of_computer_science_using_mit/
4397,All in one - global media access (taxed?),"I initially thought of posting this on r/thinktank or r/brainstorming but they are dead, and r/science only allows linking to published papers. Feel free to suggest a better sub than this if you know one.  


Convenience is king. All day.   
I'm from europe and almost all roads are public. Let me drive now, tax me later. It works just fine.  
Same with most infrastructures, water, electricity, etc.  
I don't know why this couldn't be the case for social media and virtual platforms too.

So... competition is said to be beneficial, but everyone hates logging in to a dozen different services to consume music, media, watching movies or playing games, have ""pay2use"" speedbumps and required logins etc. The goal (dream) here would be to have instant easy access to every virtual service, like browsing any page - but without ads and optional login/profiles. Seperate platforms would remain as they are best suited, optimised and with customisable interfaces and user preferences; for example steam for gaming, netflix and youtube for music, movies, shows and user generated content. Yes, there are a lot of problems, regional laws, politics, etc., let's dig into those later.   
The idea is to have everything ever made in ""one"" place, online. There shouldn't be anything like private ownership on something with extreme popularity and of high cultural value, so that it could be pulled or deleted just ""because I can"" said the owner. All of the things should be available for everyone, unedited, raw, with all the different versions, etc. 

You could download any music/ movie/ game(if possible) and play it later. No online streaming or presence required.  
You can login, set up your preferences, create a profile and lists, save custom settings, interact with the community and other users, contact creators, rate, vote, etc., all optional. Or you can hit the site/app you want and consume whatever without any of the above. You like a song and want to hear it right now? Click and go. No ads. You can even lock your phone and have the playlist go on. No bullshit. Tax me later. 

Our first problems are language and cultural barriers, so we'll be focusing on the western section for starters...   
How do we fund this? Our target market is 20% of the global population, that's NA and the EU mostly, gross 1,4 billion people. Cut \~30% (everyone under 18 and over 65) and we get a pool of roughly 1 billion tax payers.   
Progressive income based tax, the rare richest millionaires pay maybe $100-1000 a month (some sort of cap), but the monthly median citizen fee would be around $5, making more than $50 billion every year. That should be plenty to cover anything from server costs to royalties. Big brain time for all the business experts, my cost projections are based on absolutely nothing so if you have any grip on the real numbers here, let me hear you please.  

This money goes into a transparent fund, all stats trackable online open for the public.  
Published content creators/ studios/ producers get royalties paid based on total/ timely  views/ plays/ activity/ popularity.   
This should be enough motivation for companies to get their projects funded privately by displaying their stats, or apply for some sort of semi-pre-paid assistance if they provide the neccessarities. 

The second problem is freedom of speech, hot topic in a time when Alex Jones and many other get reeeeeeported and deplatformed, being targeted by the radical left that is supported by the power hungry elite and silicon valley.   
We would have to allow everyone to maintain a online presence, and let people accept to get offended and deal with it.

4398,[Question] Trouble installing new OS on Windows 8 computer,"**You can skip down to the bottom if you want, I'll bold the question and any information that I think may be important** 
***
I have a laptop that was preinstalled with Windows 8. Once you learn the trackpad shortcuts and get used to the new start screen, it's actually far better than most people say it is; however, I still find it frustrating and want to change my OS. 

#I've downloaded the Ubuntu version 13.04 64 bit disk image and burned it to a CD-R. From the disk I ran `wubi.exe` and selected the normal computer reboot option, and during reboot the disk didn't even register. I tried again, this time selecting the ""Help me boot from CD"" option. This time, after reboot, after I clicked Ubuntu at the OS selection (it did register this time) Windows Bootup Manager gave me an error saying that it couldn't load the OS because it was missing the file. The complete error message was as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Starting Windows didn't succeed. The reason may be changing software.

    To solve this problem:
        1. Insert installation disc of Windows and reboot pc
        2. Choose language settings and click Next
        3. Use Repair

    If you don't own this disk contact with the administrator.

    File: \ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr
    State: 0xc000007b
    Information: Could not load application or Operating System because of the lack of the required file or errors in this file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I tried again and it gave me the same error message. I figured it either downloaded or burned wrong, so I downloaded the disk image again and made a LiveUSB out of it.

 Again, I had the same problem of it not registering after restart.

 Again, I tried the ""Help me boot from CD"" option. 

Again, I got the same missing `\ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr` error. 

Well, maybe it was just an error with the actual files in that version, it was only released about 2 months ago, it could still be buggy and they may not have been able to fix it yet. I downloaded the Ubuntu version 12.04 64 bit disk image this time instead of version 13.04 and burned it to a different CD-R. With high hopes I ran `wubi.exe` and during boot up, the disk didn't run. No surprise there. You know the drill by now. Again, the same dreaded missing `\ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr` error from Windows Bootup Manager. Sadly, the Ubuntu through-current-operating-system installer does not have support for Windows 8.

So by now I know that there's an issue, an issue far beyond the control whatever I could do with those CD's and USB, an issue far beyond the control of however I tried to run the installation applications, an issue far beyond the control of how many times I tried installing the Operating System. I had heard of a suspiciously unrealistic-sounding new feature to Windows 8. A new feature, supposedly implemented in 2012, called Secure Boot. Curious, I opened Windows Powershell and ran the boolean command `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI`. I was hoping for the familiar, bright red ""`The term 'Command-Term/' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.`"" or at least `False` or `Cmdlet not supported on this platform`. The terminal processed the command successfully, and returned a bright white, courier, `True`

^^ಠ_ಠ

^^^God.

^^^Damnit.

For those of you who don't know, Secure Boot is part of the UEFI of machines with Windows 8. Secure Boot prevents your computer from booting any Operating System besides Windows 8, or in best case scenarios deters it and makes it the most difficult pain in the ass you will ever experience. If you have a machine that came with Windows 8, you will most likely never be able to load up a new operating system the easy, normal way. For context, imagine that crazy ex girlfriend that you broke up with. Now imagine her with a knife, a lot of ropes and chains, padlocks, and a dark soundproofed basement. Now name her Windows 8, shove her in your computer, and imagine trying to break up with her for this hot, exotic girl you met named Ubuntu the easy, normal way, especially after telling her that she has to share the computer with this chick. 

Yeah. The people who yell at sheeple for supporting Micro$oft, as ridiculous as they are, may have a point.

I'm pretty sure that Secure Boot is the issue I'm having when trying to partition my harddrive. I realize that I could always back up my files, completely reformat my harddrive, and load Ubuntu from that most likely without a problem, but I don't want to completely lose Windows 8 until I'm familiar with Ubuntu and know that I want it.

So, if any of you could find something else that may be the issue from the information given, then that would be great just in case I'm trying to fix the wrong thing. I guess the question I'm trying to ask is: **Is there a way to disable Secure Boot? Secure Boot is a new UEFI feature in Windows Operating Systems that prevents/deters any operating system besides Windows from booting. I run Windows 8 on an HP Pavilion g4. Thank you to anyone who helps, attempts to help, or even just had the intention of helping.**",1hdxc0,5,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/1hdxc0/question_trouble_installing_new_os_on_windows_8/

It's not the best or most practical,the camera is mediocre and less customisation.
I noticed most people who really like them just kinda don't know better and don't really understand basic tech shit like frame rates, or how Samsung had dual sim in 2009.
It's just really stupid that you have people who act cool, like they don't care what people think but will still buy a shit $700 phone just to not feel inferior or say ""hey, look at me I'm rich and don't eat ramen noodles because poverty is shameful"".
And it's not like they're all getting paid to flex their phones on mirror pictures they take when they're bored/drugged out, so theirs zero practicality 
Its like how ancient rich people used to eat white bread just for the status despite it having almost no flavor or nutritional value.

And just funny to look at all these ""free thinking/artistic people"" just blindly follow shit and not be practical adults and do whats in their best interest

If anything, Apple is probably one of the more virtuous of the big tech companies. They actively refused to unlock a person's phone when asked by the FBI because they care about security and people's rights to phones. Meanwhile Facebook is content with selling private data to and influencing the masses for whatever organization that pays.

Edit: I realized the 'virtuous' part was reaching a bit. TL;DR, let people use or enjoy whatever they want. You like apple and what they put out, good on you. If you don't, also good on you. If you are proactively forcing other people to change their opinions based on what you want them to think.... Stop it...

4710,Has there been any thought about a global superconductor power transfer ring?,"The idea is that if long term we have issue with storing power in batteries... then one way to fix this could be to have a gigantic low loss power transfer ring across the world.

So as the sun shine on one end of the earth, it is then pushed to the superconductor power grid to be transferred to the other side of the world as needed.

-------------------

The biggest problem with this idea, would of course... be developing the superconductor technology... as well as the political challenge of getting agreement from all countries to contribute financially to it.

4711,What ever happened to transflective (sunlight-viewable) displays?,"So I was reminded of [Pixel Qi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Qi) just now. I recall that when they were in the tech news, I was looking forward to a whole new generation of low-power electronics that could be easily used outdoors, particularly e-readers - of course, that particular product never really materialized except as a DIY part for replacing displays yourself.

 Also, in general, I recall several phones from a few years back (I think Nokia had quite a few) that were transflective - that is, you could turn down the backlight and see them in bright ambient light. This kind of energy-saving tech seems like it's just made for today's power-hungry devices, but it seems like the displays that are being billed as ""sunlight compatible"" are just designed to crank the brightness up as much as possible, using more energy and still not being quite readable. It seems like the only transflective displays I've seen in new products have been on smart watches.

So what's the deal? Have we just given up on using our devices outside when the sun is shining? It's driving me nuts, because there are a ton of great apps out there for hiking biking, and navigation, but every phone I've tried them on is unreadable in direct sunlight. It seems like phone manufacturers are trying to outdo each other as far as color and resolution in ideal conditions, and completely ignoring the part of the world where the sun is shining (which is to say, most of it, half of the time).",3iiyto,9,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/3iiyto/what_ever_happened_to_transflective/

4713,"Staying inside during the day (dim light) is now associated with mypoia. With fiber optic cables, you can easily bring in bright, necessary natural light ANYWHERE! (We really need this).","[This](https://feaeba6c997b673d9546-fdee854a0c0fddf2cfc663474a96d15c.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/imageso_0laptopso_0galagoo_0galu1o_0hero_600.jpg) is just not realistic, but system 76 thinks their laptop is brighter than clouds...

Myopia (near sightedness) is an ever increasing issue, and it's only getting worse -- I'm trying to slow it down and get everyone outside, because this is really getting out of hand.  I'll post two articles, one from CNN, very informative, and the other from Science Daily, as it has numbers of how fast myopia is spreading.

http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/06/01/myopia.causes/index.html
http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/11/141120112348.htm

I'm also going to add in a link now for fiber optic lighting, as I think it would be rude not to include it!
http://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/blogs/dept/energy-solutions/fiber-optics-daylighting
(The picture on the right can get MUCH larger, click it once, then click the + button to really get it big!

I love computers, tablets, phones etc, but **NONE** of these things work well outside because you (I) can't read the screen worth a fuck most of the time.  I had to get an Android with 660 nits brightness on auto to combat this major issue.

Office workers get extremely little light exposure during the day, offices are way way too dim.  I'm talking 200 - 300 lux at the MOST, is common, where as, 10 A.M. on a sunny winter day is 22,000 lux.  All these numbers are best case scenarios, with the sensor pointed DIRECTLY at the sky, even inside, so objects on a desk are considerably dimmer than outside.

22,000 lux is also the brightness of an overcast sky with the sun *just* about to come out, but you can't quite see it yet.
A bright clear summer sky can reach upwards of 90,000 lux!

So when I say offices are too dark I'm absolutely **serious**
So with fiber optic cables, we can fix problem, albeit expensively.  The company (Parans / HUVCO) charges $8,000 for 6 of those things in the ceiling, and not seen on the webpage is a big dish that collects the light.

What's great about this is that you can have bright natural light on MULTIPLE floors, and the light can go down about 30 feet!  (With modifications / improvements, that can go up to 60 feet.)

Having bright light during the day is WAY more important than most people could ever imagine, and it's a topic that I feel needs much more coverage.  So that's why this is going to /r/tech.",362cxd,0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/362cxd/staying_inside_during_the_day_dim_light_is_now/

4730,A letter from Huawei HiSilicon CEO He Tingbo,"To all my colleagues:  

By now you might very well already heard that U.S. Bureau of Industry  and Security (BIS) has put Huawei on the “Entity List”.  

Many years ago, when everything was going smoothly, the company made  ultimate survival assumption that one day we might have no access to any  advanced chips and technology from U.S. while the show must go on. We,  thousands of my colleagues started on this journey that no one thought  would ever happen – to make “spare tires” for Huawei. We worked  tirelessly for day and night for many years. Huawei offers such a  variety of products with so many components and diverse technologies.  Facing thousands of tough hurtles, seemingly endless failures, but we  never give up.  

Little by little, we plowed through the valley and saw the light at the  end of the tunnel.  But it’s always been on our mind if our chips will  ever see the daylight.  

Today a dark moments is upon us, the Super Power nation mercilessly cut  off our worldwide supply chain. They put Huawei on the “Entity List”  without any factual base. 

Now our “spare tire” will be put to use finally! We’ll be able to  deliver our promises to our customer without any interruption. With all  our efforts, we are able to provide the end to end components to the  company! This dark moment marks the most glorious time for every one of  my colleagues here!  

Huawei is determined to bring the digital technology to every person,  every family, and every organization and connect the world through AI.  From now on, not only we’ll continue our research and development, but  also be self-sufficient and independent! There won’t be another 10 years  for us, the buffer zone is gone now. Every new product must be  accompanied with our own independent technology program.  

Many toils ahead, but we have courage, wisdom and tenacity to conquer  and prevail in the end! Storms ahead is the time we show our true heroic  nature, no matter what, we can build our own “Noah’s Ark”.

I am working on a project about **wearable devices in the workplace**.

* Or maybe you chose to track your employees? 
* What was being measured?
* If you were tracked, did it change the way you approached your job? 
* Did you find ways around it?

* Xbox One

Unfortunately, this isn't always going to work out- for instance Xbox One doesn't have a Google Drive/Sheets/Docs or iCloud app. 
Based on that alone, Onedrive seems the best choice, but the cost is prohibitive and I prefer and already use the other market leaders.

I ran a comparison of what I could find, and here's the results. 

Red cells means it's the paid sub version, so you can see paid vs free for each service. 
Prices are in New Zealand Dollars too. xe.com will help if you get confuzzled.

Hope you are well through this challenging time. I know I am struggling a bit.

As someone with a sensory disability living in a metropolitan area, I was wondering how other people with disabilities like ourselves are managing in rural and regional areas?

Hi there,

I am looking for someone who would be interested to work with me on an idea of mine.

The idea is about an alternative search engine. I described it here on a website I made [http://www.buildthememex.org](http://www.buildthememex.org/)

Does anybody have an idea, where I could find someone like this?

Short explanation of how I imagine the Memex: It's an alternative search engine in the sense, that it provides a different kind of search experience than any other search engine. It is not just another search engine with a slightly different search algorithm, but a totaly different thing. With google for example, you retrieve a specific information. With the Memex, you would explore the internet. You would start with a very vage search term, that opens up a very big field. You then choose one of the more accurate search terms presented to you, where you expect the most to find what you are looking for. You use the Memex, when you don't know what exactly you are looking for.

Example query: ""good film""

google result: good (film) - A movie with the title ""good""

Memex result: A variety of movie trailers to choose from - where the results changes with every new selection

The way I imagine the Memex, it would also have a visual component of some sorts. Like a map, to keep track of where you are in the internet.",a4w2ai,0,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/a4w2ai/need_help_finding_a_partner_to_work_on_an_idea/

4833,The false sense of security with hidden SSIDs,"Hi everyone,

I'm a researcher at a university in the UK, currently researching Wifi localisation techniques. In my research I've realised that a lot of people broadcast personal information about themselves that they aren't aware of.

Hidden SSIDs are a way of concealing your network from the outside world, but alternatively they can be used to identify your personal unique MAC address. 

Hidden SSIDs don't broadcast, and instead require the device to actively seek out the access point in the area.

Personally, I use SSIDs that mean something to me, i.e. my name or something significant in my life, I believe that this is something that most people do. However, there are dangers to doing this.

As you can see from this [screenshot](http://imgur.com/zZk1JQj), your device broadcasts those hidden SSIDs when you are moving through areas. Any malicious attackers looking in the area for MAC addresses that can uniquely identify you will be able to do so, very easily.

Why is it dangerous? Associating a device MAC address with a person will allow a malicious attacker or security agencies to constantly detect where that user is if there are a number of compromised access points in an area. It will also enable an attacker to follow their victim home, and compromise their home network(s).

I urge everyone to rethink the name of their SSIDs if they're hidden, make it something that doesn't personally identify you, or even better, make your SSIDs public so that your device isn't actively looking for them.

Of course, I believe device manufacturers can do something about this. Device manufacturers such as Apple and Google could make their software only look for hidden SSIDs when it detects that your location correlates with a location previously stored when connecting to these hidden SSIDs.

I just finished watching the Mass Effect promo (4k youtube stream) on my 1080p 144Hz gsync monitor. Obviously, I wasn't getting the full experience by down-sampling the 4k stream to 1080p and displaying it at (effectively) 30 fps. This is because the monitor tech/drivers are wasting 3/4 of the information in the stream. 

**Instead**, why not display the video at 120 Hz where each frame displays one of the four 4k pixel values contained within each 1080p pixel? (1234)(1234)(1234), etc... 30 times per second. This procedure should apply a temporal-based anti-aliasing effect in rendered streams, as well as providing slightly smoother motion.

The download speeds are supposed to be 15mbps, and when my laptop is near the router, the speeds are near 14. Also, in certain other parts of the house, I'll have wild differences in the download speed each time I run the test. The upload speeds don't seem to be affected much by this.

4846,Exsiccate - recurrent lossless compression algorithm,"Hi,

My friend and I are working for 10+ years on compression algorithm. It is for fun but it looks like we did come to a place that progressing further without outside help is not really possible. As we do not have any good idea what or how to improve this situation I have come here.

Purpose of Exsiccate is to compress file without losing information. As it is recurrent then you can take such compressed file and compress it again. Obviously there is a lot of limitations to such algorithm. It takes plenty of time for one run as our math-fu is week.

I tried to contact universities asking if I can sponsor research/master thesis/Phd/whatever that would give us the required math for all the operations. In most cases my email had been ignored. Now I am asking you how I can find someone who would be interested in developing some math for us? Is master/Phd right way, or we should just hire someone, then how I can hire someone for such a task?

It probably is very unclear what I am saying so to give illustration of the issue we have to make adding or subbing bilion times as we are just not able to formulate clear math solution that would allow us to first group same millions of operations and handle as multiplication and addition instead of million additions.

PS. I would like to actually see any reply, even if it is just a ""no idea, keep trying"" ;)

4847,"Hackers On Planet Earth 2020 Includes A Cyberpunk Media Hackathon, ""The Cyberpunk Now Film Festival""","Hi!

I’m leading the team organizing [The Cyberpunk Now Film Festival](https://cyberpunkfestival.com/) as part of [Hackers On Planet Earth 2020](https://hope.net/).

When I heard HOPE was going virtual for coronareasons, I wanted to help make something interesting that people could do from home.

This is a **live** film festival, where **participants must make their films during the event**.

We only have a few days until the event starts, and I'm trying to get the word out. More participants is more fun.

https://cyberpunkfestival.com/

On **July 25th** we will publish top-secret ""required challenge elements"" that have to be included in the projects (meant to establish a level playing field), and then participants will have 5 days to make a film.

The thinking is that we're very much living in a world predicted by the cyberpunk literature of the 80s and 90s, and so much of what was science fiction is now routine or the chaotic backdrop of our daily life. So, what better time to help people express themselves through this sort of channel?

Please help us get the word out about the event, and absolutely please participate. Even if you don't participate, definitely tune in on August 2nd for a screening of the winners in the HOPE livestream (not sure what time yet).

Our very colorful promo graphic can be found here: https://i.imgur.com/cHnjvN2.jpg

We're not trying to make a huge profit from submission fees. The submission fee is a speed bump to prevent low quality submission spamming. This is more of a volunteer-run thing, just fun for the community. You get a discount if you pre-register, and submissions are free if you’re also participating in HOPE.

Comments? Questions?

**Something keeps coming up that I think is interesting: Is cyberpunk dystopian?** Wikipedia says yes, but some of the famous authors say no. I put a note about this in the FAQ on the festival site, but in summary, cyberpunk was about a future where the world didn't end in a nuclear holocaust, and it is a genre which arose in the 80s, when that was a likely outcome, so many say it isn't dystopian at all, that it is rather a hopeful genre.

If you'd like to make your own VR content to watch and share with your friends, keep reading!

Most were taken with a [GoPro Fusion](https://amzn.to/3skyoHI) which takes excellent video and pictures, but the workflow is absolute hell and it's no longer supported by GoPro. The quality is outstanding though

I used a [360Rize 360Penguin](https://amzn.to/3vVDhti) for others. I kinda love these little cameras. They are versatile and stitch the videos in-camera (as do the rest below). You can even live-stream with them with a little effort and a decent PC. The quality is comparable to the GoPro Fusion, except that low-light and stabilization might get funky. On a budget, this is a bad bird, however, and should not be passed by for the price

For some, I used a [Vivitar 360 camera](https://amzn.to/3lQooDJ). These things kinda suck, but they're cheap enough you won't mind sticking them to a drone for those really spectacular overhead views

I used a [Utopia360 Elite Edition (vPai) Camera](https://amzn.to/3ciRZ5H) for some as well. This camera is low resolution, but it's super-versatile. You can use it in so many ways. Be sure to install the [vPai app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.via.vpai) on your phone, rather than the Utopia360 one. It's way better. You won't mind letting the kids run off with this camera either. The price is ridiculous

I'm buying a 15U 19"" rack cabinet for servers, routers and switches for my home. A bit overkill maybe, but I'm studying to become a network engineer or sysadmin, so it will help in that aspect. Also, my significant other prefers me to hide my tech to the best of my abilities, so a single rack is the best choice for us. To add to the storage for the computers my family uses, I now wish to buy one or two NAS-devices, and place them in that cabinet.

Hi r/tech ! We are a team of students in general management in Switzerland and for the last year of our master we work in relationship with a center of microtechnics and electrotechnics that developed a technology and we must find applications for it. But to do that we first want to know what people even expect from it!  I know this sounds like self-promotion but I won't be giving away the company name nor any contact info (and this Reddit account is my personal), what we really want are your opinions.

  

But first a presentation of said device:

--------------

Our device is a sensor that measures and monitors different factors such as air quality, temperature, humidity, light and it can also use a camera to take pictures. The device is plugged on a flexible photovoltaic cell (PV cell) that can also generate power in non-direct sunlight (inside a room, house, ...). The PV cell is built as a sticker so you can basically stick it wherever you want. The device works in ultra-low-power (ULP) and communicates the data through Bluetooth LE. 

Photo of our sensor: https://i.imgur.com/93joHc8.png

We can integrate different captors (visual, sound, infra-red, chemical) it holds a battery, a memory chip and a small processor that can support an already trained IA or another basic program.

The consumer buys the number of “PV stickers and sensors” that they needs. They can use one by room to monitor their interior. Then the data can be sent (encrypted or not) to their phone / computer or monitoring device. Our goal there is to save energy and its costs by monitoring your interior simply and efficiently.

Since the device can support an already trained IA we wanted to make it open source so that any customer can create their own program and share it with the community. Which is where you might be interested?

--------------------------------------

  

We're looking for opinions, inputs, etc on this tool, especially from people with programming background (but from everyone really).

What do you think about this technology? Would you have use for it? What would you make you want to use it? And how far would you go with this?",dw030n,0,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/dw030n/developing_a_witness_sensor_would_love_to_hear_if/

I've heard that the game I play does NOT work on VM, but there's apparently some way around it - something about deleting the VM graphic drivers, which by pass the ""is this a VM check?"", but I am worried the game would not run well without those drivers.

4857,Queue up for the next iDevice OR this ......,"Hi everyone.

Given the amount of excitement and enthusiasm that is generated every time a new Apple or Samsung (etc.) device is released, I got to thinking that there could be a way of capitalising on that enthusiasm in a positive way without costing truckloads of money and hopefully provide some great outcomes for local communities.

Most of us by now are aware of the waiting period between announcement of iDevices and when we can actually get our hands on them. Instead of queuing up outside a store waiting to be one of the first to own a new iDevice, how about making better use of that time and be rewarded for the effort?

When a new iDevice is announced for pre-order, how about the option of receiving said iDevice a few days earlier than the general public, if you agree to take part in a charitable activity to benefit your local community.

Think along the lines of volunteering in cleaning up a part of your city / town, soup kitchen, workshop for those disadvantaged, playing a gig, anything that benefits your community in a positive way.

This would more than likely be done in conjunction with a charity and all need to be above board, subject to fair play, auditing and so on.

Obviously to keep it viable there would have to be organised activities with limited places and ultimately it would have (hopefully) have a very positive impact on local communities.

14:45Michelle W.: I am not sure what the rates were at that time for the 50Mbps. It look like on 2/25/2012 you upgraded to the 50Mbps for $64.99 + taxes.
14:45me: So, you care more about new customers than me?
14:45Michelle W.: That rate was good until 4/1/2013.
14:46me: I have been a member for 22 months. the price, for 22 months, at 50 mb, is what?
14:46me: 54.99
14:46me: yes or no?
14:47Michelle W.: I have it was $59.99 + modem rental of $5.00
14:47me: I'm not interested in that. look at your plan right now. on your own website, and tell me the price
14:48Michelle W.: The current 2013 new customer pricing is $54.99 with Modem rental.
14:48me: your charging me 93
14:48me: see a difference?
14:49me: I don't care, about new customers. I have been with you 22 months
14:49Michelle W.: When you upgraded the package it was only good until 4/1/2013. After that was over the account goes to full retail.
14:49me: I was not informed of that
14:49me: So, RCN's official stand is that you are fine screwing me over?
14:50me: they told me, when I upgraded, that my price was in line with what the website says
14:50me: So you are fine screwing me over?
14:50Michelle W.: Regular retail rates to apply all discounts have ended.
14:50me: why?
14:50me: 22 months
14:50me: do you understand that
14:51Michelle W.: The rates are constantly changing.
14:51me: so you lied to me when I upgraded, and over charge me now
14:51Michelle W.: Every quarter the packages online change.
14:51me: does it cost you more to give me internet than someone who just signs on?
14:51me: no
14:51me: it does not
14:51me: so why do I have to pay more
14:51me: I should be refunded for the whole month
14:52Michelle W.: We do send a statement monthly either by email or mail that has the cost of what is being taken out of the account and for the dates of the services.
14:53Michelle W.: Did you not get your current statement?
14:53me: I'm still a 22 month customer, I should be on standard price
14:53me: don't give me excuses, I don't give a shit about what you are saying to me. As a business if you have an unhappy customer, you do what you can to fix it
14:53me: you don't make excuses
14:53me: you fix it
14:54Michelle W.: Are you looking to transfer services over to the new address?
14:54me: I don't know, after this, I don't think I want to be with you
14:54Michelle W.: I would be able to see about getting new customer pricing and having this current bill backdated?
14:54Michelle W.: *.
14:55me: How about, you get it back dated for me now. and then we will discuss on whether I keep you or not
14:56Michelle W.: May I have the address you currently moved to?
14:56me: no, look into getting it back dated for me now, then I will be willing to discuss with you further
14:56Michelle W.: I would only be able to backdate with a transfer of service.
14:56me: beyond that, I have nothing to say to you
14:56me: so, tell me
14:56me: is RCN ok with screwing me over
14:56me: don't give me a corporate line
14:56me: don't give me PC bullshit
14:57me: give me a straight answer
14:57me: is your company ok with overcharging and stealing money from me
14:57Michelle W.: I can not backdate the current statement as is. We send out notification. I do not think that we are pulling anything over on you.
14:57me: Why can you not back date it, if you could if I kept you?
14:57me: that's bullshit and you know it
14:58me: So, yes, RCN's official line, is that your fine with stealing money from me?
14:58Michelle W.: When it comes to backdating and getting the new customer package on I have to have it set up as a transfer of service to a new address. Without having the new address and placing the transfer, the system doesn't allow anything to be placed on the account.
14:59me: I am posting this entire chat and my bankstatement to Reddit, 4chan, and any other forum I can find, and making sure you lose business, if you do nothing to help me.
14:59Michelle W.: I am trying to help and get you a new package and help with the last statement.
15:00me: for 22 months, the price is 54.99. i have been paying 64.99. I am still under 24 months, and you are charging 93 dollars, you are stealing from me.
15:00me: I am not willing to get a transfer, as I am unwilling to trust you again
15:00Michelle W.: The price is not $54.99 for 22 months. The rate was only good for 12 months.
15:01me: bullshit
15:01me: check your website now
15:01Michelle W.: I am on the website.
15:01me: I was told that my rate would be in line with what the website said, when I switched over
15:01me: even then, it was never at 93 dollars
15:02me: It was 64.99 at 3 years when I signed up, and less than that for 2 years, and less for 1. When I upgraded, I was only with you for like 6 months
15:03me: Does RCN support Loyalty?
15:03Michelle W.: We did give you new customer pricing that was available at that time.
15:03me: then it should have been available for 3 years!!!
15:03me: you have a 3 year pricing assurance
15:03Michelle W.: From what is on there now and what was on there then are different, to what was offered last year.
15:04me: How does it go from 65 to 93
15:04Michelle W.: Currently, Yes we have the three year pricing assurance. When you upgraded that is not available. You were placed into a package that was available at that time.
15:04me: give me a detailed list of expenses. Even last year, if you gave me new customer price, as you assure me you have, you had a 3 year pricing assurance
15:05me: yes it was, not the same prices, but you absolutely had 3 year price assurance
15:05Michelle W.: You went to full retail as of 4/1/2013
15:05me: full retail is not a detailed list
15:05me: do you understand what I am asking of you, yes or now
15:05me: no*(
15:05Michelle W.: You were not placed in a three year pricing package.
15:05me: bullshit
15:05me: I absolutely was, you had a 3 year price plan.
15:05me: even back then
15:06Michelle W.: At this time I do not have a detailed list of expenses.
15:06Michelle W.: Would you like me to help with seeing if we can transfer your services and see if we can get the current statement backdated?
15:07me: No, because I don't trust your shitty business. I expect a credit for my entire month.
15:07me: WHy would i trust you with more service after stealing money from me?
15:07Michelle W.: I do apologize, a credit will not be placed on the account at this time.
15:07me: Do you have a boss? and can I talk to them please
15:08Michelle W.: We did sent out notification of the account charges before it was processed.
15:08me: If that's true, i never got it
15:08me: but i doubt the truth of such a statement
15:08me: Let me speak to your boss
15:08Michelle W.: They are not available at this time. They are out of the office. You can call us at 800-746-4726 and ask to speak with a Manager.
15:08me: they are out of the office at 3pm on a tuesday?
15:09Michelle W.: Correct! They are not in the office this week.
15:09me: wow, you guys have superb customer service.
15:10Michelle W.: Any additional questions I can help you with today?
15:10me: You can start with my 25 dollar credit that I was offered. That will almost cover my overdraft charge, that I received after being overcharged.
15:10me: Can I have your full name please, not just a w
15:11me: because I would like to know it, when talking to someone on the phone
15:11me: You have my last name, it's only fair
15:11Michelle W.: I will place the $25.00 Credit on the account for you that Max did offer. I can give you my employees ID number 021441. I am the only Michelle W.
15:12me: Also, I hope RCN looks forward to this conversation being posted on Reddit, Digg, 4chan, and other various internet forums
15:13Michelle W.: I have also posted the chat in your account so when you do call anyone can reference it.
15:13Michelle W.: The credit is now applied to the account. Your next statement will so a one time credit of $25.00.

4910,Would deleting & re-joining facebook every few months be sufficient to stop user data aggregation/commodification?,"Basically asking what I said in the title, a lot of people don't want FB to collect their data and sell it to advertisers but this is all based on their competence at building a user dataset for you that remains a stable indicator of your interests and ideology over time. That is curtailed by deleting your facebook and re-joining on a regular basis. Right? Perhaps not if they still have the dataset saved after you delete, and then just shift it back to your new profile using facial recognition. Not sure if that's technologically feasible for them at this point, though it's easy enough theoretically. (Surely they could just as easily do it through IP address detection but that's super easy for most people to spoof.) Furthermore it would depend on how long they store your data after you delete your account. Is it only for 10-90 days, which is how long they claim to store non-users' browsing data?",akfwn2,52,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/akfwn2/would_deleting_rejoining_facebook_every_few/

4998,[META] Your weekly reminder of what the difference is between here and /r/technology,"http://i.imgur.com/KfYE9bP.png

Have you heard of our Lord and Savior Net Neutrality?  Are you *sure*?  Are you *really sure*?

By the way people, **this** is why we want to only allow the one stickied thread on the subject.  This news is Reddit's hot story, and since it's tangentially related to technology it's allowed there.  A month from now there will be another hot story with great titlebait links that plasters the front of every sub that allows news. 

Stressed out admins counts at ""pure tech""... somehow.  Pretty much sums up the state of that sub.

The completely false story about /r/technology, ON /r/technology, is a nice ending. Now let's compare...

http://i.imgur.com/0Cd52l6.png

Damn, that's a beefy solar plant (molten salt plants are awesome).  Look, a spacesuit (no really, look, it's pretty ridiculous).  Artificial leaves?  Tiny satellites? And below my cutoff we have a computer that argues, a 3-D printed house, and some other good stuff.

Here's my vision for /r/tech: the technology equivalent to /r/science.  Whereas /r/science is about new scientific results from studies/experimentation, /r/tech should be about novel and awesome innovation. That's what it looks like it's heading towards, and I hope we keep it that way.  Not whether Johnny Handjob of the Fuckall committee said three words about net neutrality.  Not clickbait that gets upvoted because Comcast is bad.",24pa7g,505,102,https://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/24pa7g/meta_your_weekly_reminder_of_what_the_difference/
